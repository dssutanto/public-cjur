As Yukawa et al. (2013) note, diatom analysis is often considered to be “the gold standard” (p. 1) of the many laboratory tests which determine death by drowning. Over 150,000 diatom species (unicellular algae) exist which can be found wherever sufficient light exists to support photosynthesis in most natural water bodies (Hendey, 1973). Diatoms preserve well, occur in high numbers, are detectible in almost all environments, and are environmentally specific (Horton et al., 2006; Pollanen et al., 1997). The main principle is that diatoms are present in the medium where drowning occurred and they will therefore also be present in body tissues (Horton et al., 2006; Krstic et al., 2002; Pollanen, 1998).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diatom frustules, the subject of analysis, have hard box-like silica skeletons which are resistant to acid digestion and are almost indestructible, being soluble only in strong acid solutions (Fucci et al., 2015; Hendey, 1973; Seo et al., 2013), making post-mortem analysis possible (Pollanen et al., 1997). Diatom analysis allows forensic pathologists to determine the specific medium which the victim drowned in (e.g. fresh water, sea water, or lake water) because different diatom frustules can be found where environmental conditions differ due to narrow tolerances for temperature, light, salt content, environmental pollution, and pH levels (Levin et al., 2017; Tavassi et al., 2008). Thus, different species will be found in different bodies of water around the world (Auer, 1991; Coelho et al., 2016; Ludes, 2013; Peabody, 1977). Different species will also be present at different depths due to varying photosynthesis abilities (Auer, 1991).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diatoms can be recovered from fresh, decomposed, and burnt tissues (Fucci et al., 2015) because prior to drowning, the victim would still have a beating heart which would allow diatoms to travel throughout the body via the circulatory system (Ago et al., 2011). Combining the inhalation of water and a beating heart allow diatoms to pass into the bloodstream as part of the oxygen exchange process (Rohn &amp; Frade, 2006). As part of this process, diatoms then penetrate the lungs when water is inhaled, become lodged in alveoli, and can also be carried to internal organs such as the kidneys, heart, brain, and bone marrow (Ago et al., 2011; Antonenko &amp; Ferris, 1987; Horton et al., 2006; Krstic et al., 2000; Pollanen et al., 1997). Thus, it is unlikely diatoms would be found in the internal organs or bone marrow of bodies disposed of in water post-mortem (Krstic et al., 2002). This makes diatom analysis helpful in determining whether a victim drowned or was disposed of in water post-mortem (Gruspier &amp; Pollanen, 2000). In rare cases however individuals suffer rapid heart failure prior to drowning preventing circulation of diatoms and their entrance into internal organs (Antonenko &amp; Ferris, 1987; Piette &amp; De Letter, 2006).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diatom analysis however remains controversial because diatoms can be found in tissues of people who died of causes other than drowning due to the widespread distribution of diatoms through the environment in soil, food, and air (Lucci et al., 2008). Diatoms can also implant passively into the lungs, stomach contents, and upper airways, leading to unreliable analyses (Ago et al., 2011; Coelho et al., 2016). Diatom analysis remains in use however, because the diagnosis of drowning is highly complex (Ludes et al., 1999; Stephensen et al., 2019; Timperman, 1972), and other signs of drowning can in many cases be insignificant or non-existent and may dissipate after death (Badu et al., 2015). Diatom analysis was recently used in a United Kingdom animal cruelty case which determined that an owner drowned their dog in a canal (BBC News, 2019; Johnson, 2019). As opinions on its usefulness remains controversial (Yukawa et al., 2013), it is important to evaluate the technique in greater detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through evaluation of older and more recent literature, this paper aims to review the strengths and weaknesses of diatom analysis and determine whether it can still be considered a reliable technique in analysing possible cases of death by drowning. Much of the older literature on diatom analysis has been included as it is foundational to the evolution of the technique. Literature for this paper was collected through library resources at Simon Fraser University and additional online searches for related peer-reviewed literature. As reliability of analysis remains controversial amongst the scientific community (Carballeira et al., 2018), and testing historically laborious (Zhou et al., 2020), it is important to analyse the literature to determine whether the development of new techniques has increased the reliability. It will be seen in the literature that although weaknesses still exist, modern research and laboratory techniques have strengthened the reliability of diatom analysis showing that it should still be considered a strong forensic tool.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 id=\"discussion\">Discussion</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 id=\"strengths\">Strengths</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Coelho et al. (2016) note the scientific principle of environmental specificity establishes the validity of diatom analysis. As specific diatom species are found in different water bodies, the presence of diatoms in the deep tissues or bone marrow of victims can lead to a definitive diagnosis of death by drowning (Auer, 1991; Pollanen, 1998). The diatoms present in bone marrow and other tissues can be compared to samples taken from the medium to determine an approximate drowning site to see if similar diatom species are present (Auer, 1991; Hürlimann et al., 2000; Pollanen, 1998). Environmental specificity makes diatom analysis a good indicator to use in investigating suspicious deaths where drowning is not suspected, because diatoms present in the bone marrow will match those found in the body of water where the victim was found (Pollanen et al., 1997).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When diatoms are present in high quantities, it is possible to pin-point the exact location where drowning took place (Peabody, 1977), but only if the drowning area is localized such as in a pond or a ditch (Auer, 1991). It is possible however to approximate the location due to environmental specificity (Auer, 1991); diatoms would need to be sampled from surrounding areas and waterbodies if the exact location is unknown (Coelho et al., 2016).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Determining which diatom species are present in body tissues can also help establish the potential drowning location and the time of death due to seasonal variability. The prevalence of diatoms in waterbodies also varies seasonally (Hendey, 1973; Pollanen et al., 1997). Diatom blooms (when concentrations are highest) follow seasonal patterns with diatom concentrations spiking in April before decreasing throughout the summer and occurring in lower numbers through the winter months (Pollanen et al., 1997). Seasonal variability can be used to scientifically determine an approximate time of death as the diatom density in bone marrow would reflect water concentrations at the time of death (Hürlimann et al., 2000). As the success of diatom analysis is correlated with diatom concentrations in the environment, diatom analysis is most successful in summer months and least successful in winter months when concentrations are low (Pollanen at al., 1997).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The presence of even a few diatoms in organs other than the lungs can be a reliable indicator of death by drowning (Hendey, 1973). Peabody (1977) suggested that their discovery in bone marrow is an even better indicator. This is supported by Auer (1991), who specifies that analysis of diatoms found in bone marrow is the only definitive way to diagnose death by drowning in decomposed bodies. This is because diatoms can enter internal organs during the body decomposition process, sometimes making analysis unreliable (Coelho et al., 2016; (Pollanen et al., 1997). Diatom analysis may be the only way to determine death by drowning after attempted resuscitation or post-mortem mutilation (Timperman, 1972). Lungs are excluded from analysis if the chest has been torn open and lungs have contacted water. Hendey (1973) and Pollanen et al. (1997) suggest that analysis of bone marrow from intact long bones like the femur are preferred. The absence of diatoms does not eliminate drowning as the cause of death, as it is possible that drowning may have occurred in water containing few or no diatoms (Pachar &amp; Cameron, 1993; Peabody, 1977).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To solve this issue, minimum quantitative thresholds have been established and more research has been done regarding diatom density in different body tissues. Pachar and Cameron (1993) established minimum thresholds for diatoms within a victim’s organs and tissues to diagnose death by drowning, only making positive diagnoses when a significant difference existed between the number of diatoms in the lungs and those in closed organs such as bone marrows. In a study by Ago et al. (2011), drowning patterns were assessed based on diatom density in the drowning medium, suggesting that diatom concentrations will be the highest in the lungs and will decrease as the diatoms circulate into deeper organs such as the bone marrow. The higher the diatom concentration is in the drowning medium, the greater the likelihood of positive results (Ago et al., 2011; Antonenko &amp; Ferris, 1987).</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 id=\"weaknesses\">Weaknesses</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there are many strengths with the diatom analysis technique, it is highly important to also discuss the various weaknesses. Diatoms can be introduced into the body through regular activities such as breathing, eating, or drinking small diatom cells (Krstic et al., 2002). If exposure to materials containing diatoms occurs, the victim’s organs cannot be used as evidence of drowning due to the pre-exposure (Taylor, 1994). Issues arise as marine diatoms can be well preserved in limestone, become aerosolized, and then inhaled, allowing them to enter the bloodstream (Moshkovitz et al., 1983). The lungs therefore are not good organs to analyse due to potential contamination (Horton et al., 2006; Pachar &amp; Cameron, 1993). Inhalation however may be negligible (Antonenko &amp; Ferris, 1987), as the body can naturally eliminate some foreign particles and prevent them from entering the organs (Pachar &amp; Cameron, 1993). Therefore, further research is needed to analyse potential diatom build up in organs (Law &amp; Jayaprakash, 2007).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Issues may arise however when victims are found in drowning mediums they were previously exposed to. Taylor (1994) notes a specific case where a victim was discovered in a body of water that they swam in every day for 15 years. Due to prior exposure, forensic scientists were unable to distinguish whether the victim last entered the waterbody alive or was environmentally predisposed to the same diatom species (Taylor, 1994). Further, little consensus exists regarding whether diatoms are accurate indicators of death by drowning, as diatoms can be found in swimmers or fishermen who were previously exposed to diatoms (Diaz-Palma et al., 2009). Thus, analysts must remain prudent in analysing victim records for previous diatom exposure events (Antonenko &amp; Ferris, 1987).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lab contamination can also impact findings in non-drowned victims as diatoms may be present in water used to wash lab instruments (Pollanen et al., 1997). Diatoms from instruments could mix with the bone marrow solution, resulting in false positives (Pollanen et al., 1997). Lunetta et al. (2013) suggest that flasks and equipment be cleaned every 24 hours using sodium hydroxide and that old flasks with minor irregularities be replaced to prevent contamination, arguing that contamination is not an impediment once proper controls are implemented. Contamination however remains inevitable (Ago et al., 2011) although it can be mitigated through environmental specificity (Pollanen et al., 1997).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diagnosing death by drowning is difficult in a body that has been severely dismembered or fragmented due to environmental exposure (Lunetta et al., 2013; Peabody, 1980). During decomposition, diatoms can passively enter soft tissues and organs (Hendey, 1973; Krstic et al., 2002), making the presence of diatoms in the lungs and stomach of potential cases of drowning inconclusive (Ago et al., 2011; Coelho et al., 2016). Large lacerations can also allow diatoms passive entry into the body, impacting the reliability of analysis (Hendey, 1973). As previously noted, diatoms can also passively enter airways through other means even when a victim did not drown (Bortolotti et al., 2011). Experts must therefore proceed with caution when interpreting diatom results from a decomposing body (Lunetta et al., 2013). Diatoms however are found in much higher concentrations in the bodies of drowning victims than of those disposed of in water post-mortem (Lunetta et al., 2013), and modern research techniques have been created to distinguish between true and false positives (Shen et al., 2019).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapid death can also prevent diatoms from circulating through the blood stream for a variety of reasons (Antonenko &amp; Ferris, 1987; Piette &amp; De Letter, 2006). Therefore, in some cases, other investigative methods must be used. Further, although finding high diatom concentrations may indicate voluntary water inhalation (Auer, 1991), lungs are not always a good organ for analysis as diatoms can passively enter them (Ago et al., 2011; Coelho et al., 2016; Pachar &amp; Cameron, 1993; Timperman, 1972). In some cases, diatoms may only be found in the lungs and not other body tissues, meaning it would not be possible to definitively diagnose drowning as the cause of death (Bortolotti et al., 2011; Pollanen et al., 1997).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Horton et al. (2006) also suggest that it may be difficult to conclude if a death was a homicide or a natural drowning, as similar diatom species can be found in different water sources. For example, if a body was found in a lake that the city used for its water supply, it would be impossible to conclude whether the individual drowned in the lake or in a bathtub as the diatom species in either waterbody would not be distinct. Further, due to the low occurrence of positive results, the likelihood of a false positive is relatively small as well, however this rate can be reduced through quantitative analysis (Ludes et al., 1999; Ludes, 2013; Lunetta et al., 2013; Pollanen et al, 1997). The establishment of a minimum threshold can help distinguish deaths by drowning due to much higher concentrations of diatoms often found in drowning victims (Shen et al., 2019). As Shen et al. (2019) found, significant statistical differences exist between false positives and true cases of drowning, lessening their impact on analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main disadvantage of the diatom test however is its sensitivity (Pollanen, 1998). The study by Pollanen et al. (1997) only obtained a positive result in 30% of freshwater drownings, meaning that diatom frustules will not be detectible in the majority of cases. As can be seen by the cited literature however, much of the original foundational analysis was completed in the 1970’s, 80’s, and 90’s. It is therefore important to analyse the impact that modern techniques have had on diatom analysis as a technique to determine cause of death. Liu et al. (2020) note that the substantial technological changes in recent decades have led to the development of new techniques that have increased the accuracy and reliability of diatom analysis. These methods, as Carballeira et al. (2018) note, have helped further validate it in the forensic sciences.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact of modern research advances</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the weaknesses of diatom analysis are significant, it can be seen that modern research from 2013 to present shows that the reliability of diatom analyses can improve with new techniques and that controversies surrounding it have been reduced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many digestion techniques have been developed to separate the diatoms from organs. Analysis can be completed with a much higher sensitivity using modern microwave digestion techniques, vacuum filtration, and high-resolution electronic microscopy (Hu et al., 2013). Fucci et al. (2015) also found that using hydrogen peroxide led to the discovery of nine new diatom species compared to the traditional hydrochloric acid method. Zhao et al. (2017) developed a new microwave digestion technique using scanning electron microscopy which led to a 97% positive test rate when evaluating closed organs (liver and kidneys). This was a was an approximate 70% increase from the 27% positive test rate from Pollanen et al. (1997), showing that reliability of diatom analysis has increased substantially with the development of new techniques which produce more accurate and reliable results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers have also found ways to reduce issues surrounding false positive results, which is the greatest threat to diatom analysis reliability (Shen et al., 2019). Shen et al. (2019) found that statistical differences in diatom concentrations in bodily tissues existed between cases of true drowning and false positive results. Although diatoms can be found in victims who did not drown due to passive entry, the number of diatoms found in all organs are significantly greater in cases where victims were known to have drowned (Shen et al., 2019). This new method developed by Shen et al. (2019) shows that parameters can be set to allow forensic pathologists to distinguish between true and false positive cases and to better determine when false positive results emerge. Research by Li et al. (2019) further highlights the use of the ratio of diatom concentration in the lung tissues to the diatom concentration of the drowning medium to increase reliability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To reduce the impact of contamination, Seo et al. (2013) used DNA-binding properties to isolate the diatoms from the heart blood sample after chemical digestion, which allowed for the separation of diatoms from other impurities, easing detection of diatoms. Seo et al. (2014) also developed a technique using silica-coated magnetic beads to separate diatoms from contaminants which showed significant improvements over previous methods. Zhou et al. (2019) also discovered that artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to automatically identify diatoms on a slide, which increases the efficiency of analysis. As diatom analysis remains “time consuming and burdensome” (Zhou et al., 2019, p. 1), the discovery of the reliable use of AI as a rapid and objective method is encouraging to the forensic sciences. Zhou et al. (2019) note that additional research is still necessary to further explore the use of AI. Kakizaki et al. (2019) also worked to develop a new diatom digestion method using papain &#8211; a vegetable enzyme from papaya &#8211; instead of the more laborious and hazardous traditional acid-digestion method. They noted that this method was promising, and that additional development should be undertaken. These studies show that additional research can further refine diatom analysis methods so external factors no longer present grave impediments.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the reliability of diatom analysis has been questioned due to the prevalence of false positive results and past issues with sensitivity in low diatom concentrations, it can be seen that modern research and laboratory techniques have addressed many of the existing concerns (Shen et al., 2019). Modern research has helped strengthen diatom analysis and it remains an important and necessary forensic tool, as diagnosing death by drowning can be highly complex. Along with its existing strengths, which include the presence of diatoms in almost every drowning medium, environmental specificity, seasonal variability, and significant quantitative differences between drowned and non-drowned victims, the reliability of diatom analysis continues to increase due to the use of modern research techniques and additional research. Since the foundational research of the 1970’s and 80’s, many significant developments have improved the reliability of diatom analysis and reduced many of its grave weaknesses, including the ability to better distinguish between true positive and false positive results. As diatom analysis remains one of the only definitive ways to determine death by drowning due to the lack of alternative methods, the literature shows that additional refinement and research can continue to improve the technique, making analysis easier, less hazardous, and less time consuming, so that forensic pathologists continue to have this tool at their disposal and that its important role in forensic sciences can continue.</p>\n</div></div>\n","uri":"/diatom-analysis-reviewing-the-strengths-weaknesses-and-impact-of-modern-research/","articleMetadata":{"articleData":{"abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to review the theoretical and laboratory techniques which underpin diatom analysis and its ability to help determine death by drowning in a forensic context.

(Kenney <em>et al.</em>, 2016). The NVU is comprised of endothelial cells, basal lamina covered by smooth muscle cells (replaced by pericytes in capillaries), astrocytes, neurons, and the extracellular matrix, which interact as a major conduit in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis, among other functions (Salehi, Zhang, &amp; Obenaus, 2017; Kenney <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Muoio, Persson, and Sendeski, 2014).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In particular, damage to the cerebral vasculature often results in neuroinflammation (Schimmel, Acosta, &amp; Lozano, 2017; Elder <em>et al</em>., 2015). Damage to the vasculature can alter the extracellular matrix, promoting the infiltration of peripheral leukocytes into the CNS and activating resident glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia (George &amp; Geller, 2018). Chronic activation of glial cells in the brain contribute to elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-6 and TNF-α (Schimmel, Acosta, &amp; Lozano, 2017; Elder <em>et al</em>., 2015), and secondary cell death in the cascade of TBI sequelae (Schimmel, Acosta, &amp; Lozano, 2017). These elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in turn lead to an increased expression of adhesion factors, such as ICAM-1 in astrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells alike, which enables increased leukocyte binding to the endothelium. The increase in leukocyte binding lead back to increased efflux of immune cells from the blood vessels to the brain parenchyma, completing the vicious cycle of transendothelial leukocyte extravasation and pro-longed neuroinflammation (Lutton <em>et al</em>., 2017; Balabanov <em>et al</em>., 2001; McKeating &amp; Andrews, 1998; Shrikant <em>et al</em>., 1995).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strong association of vascular injury with TBI has prompted an exploration into the linkage between general vascular health and injury outcome. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has well -defined vasoprotective effects in peripheral blood vessels outside of the brain , with low plasma levels of HDL firmly established as a predictor for cardiovascular disease (Besler, Lüscher, &amp; Landmesser, 2012; Mahdy Ali, Wonnerth, Huber, &amp; Wojta, 2012). ApoA-I, the major protein component of circulating HDL in plasma, has been shown to reduce inflammation through the inhibition of macrophage chemotaxis and reduced monocyte recruitment from the circulation to the tissue (Iqbal <em>et al</em>., 2016; Yin <em>et al</em>., 2011). It does this by the suppression of adhesion molecules expressed on endothelial cells (Calabresi <em>et al</em>., 1997). In addition, it promotes endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity, thereby reducing inflammation via downregulation of the pro-inflammatory NFκB signalling pathway (Boyce, Button, Soo, &amp; Wellington, 2017).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ApoA-I is produced by hepatocytes and enterocytes in the liver and small intestines respectively. Although ApoA-I mRNA is not expressed in the brain (Elliott, Weickert, &amp; Garner, 2010), its protein is detected in the brain and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). While it is unclear whether the protective effects of peripheral ApoA-I is shared in the brain, recent evidence supports the role of HDL in reducing neuroinflammation in mice models. This includes the finding of increased vascular ICAM-1 expression as well as increased vessel-associated astrogliosis among ApoA-I KOmice when compared to mice hemizygous for ApoA-I (Button <em>et al</em>., 2019).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these results suggest that peripheral ApoA-I may also exhibit vasoprotective properties in the CNS, whether ApoA-I can offer protection from TBI-induced brain changes has not been tested. To investigate the protective role of ApoA-I, we utilized a previously published CHIMERA (Closed-Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration) model of TBI, developed by our group, (Cheng <em>et al</em>., 2019; Vonder Haar <em>et al</em>., 2019; Namjoshi <em>et al</em>., 2014, Bashir <em>et al</em>.,2020) to induce a closed-head, surgery-free and clinically relevant TBI to ApoA-I Knockout (ApoA-I KO) and wild type (WT) mice. In this study, we tested the novel hypothesis that ApoA-I KO would worsen acute vascular and inflammatory outcomes in mice after CHIMERA TBI as indicated by increased pro-inflammatory brain cytokine levels and vascular adhesion factors. Overall, this study helps shed light on the function of ApoA-I in the brain and by extension, uncovering HDL as a potential therapeutic in improving post TBI inflammatory outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Animals and CHIMERA procedure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All procedures involving animals were approved by the Canadian Council of Animal Care and the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. Male and female ApoA-I KO [B6.129P2-Apoa1tm1Unc/J] and WT [C57BL/6J] mice (total N=64) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Animals were 3.5-5 months of age at the time of impact and were randomized into sham or TBI groups of 6hr or 2D endpoints. The TBI group received an impact energy of 2.5 J whereas the sham group received anesthesia and restraint but no impact. A schematic of the experimental timeline is shown in Figure 1. The CHIMERA model was used to induce TBI as described previously (Bashir <em>et al</em>.,2020). Two ApoA-I KO mice (10% of injury group) died right after CHIMERA procedures due to apnea and no WT animals expired prematurely. The groupings for all animals kept for final analysis were;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WT-6hr (Sham:N=6 (3 Male, 3 Female), TBI:N=8 (5 Male, 3 Female)); WT-2D (Sham:N=6 (3 Male, 3 Female), TBI:N=7 (4 Male, 3 Female)); ApoA-I KO-6hr (Sham:N=7 (3 Male, 4 Female), TBI:N=9 (5 Male, 4 Female)); ApoA-I KO-2D (Sham:N=8 (4 Male, 4 Female) , TBI:N=11(5 Male, 6 Female)) respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top\" class=\"gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper-constrained wp-image-2839 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" data-reactroot=\"\"><div style=\"max-width:1024px;display:block\"><img alt=\"\" role=\"presentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height=&#x27;401&#x27; width=&#x27;1024&#x27; xmlns=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#x27; version=&#x27;1.1&#x27;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" style=\"max-width:100%;display:block;position:static\"/></div><div aria-hidden=\"true\" data-placeholder-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%\"></div><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" data-srcset=\"/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/94527/CheungF1.webp 256w,/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/d02ac/CheungF1.webp 512w,/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/bdd14/CheungF1.webp 1024w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"1\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/f72f2/CheungF1.png\" data-srcset=\"/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/94b40/CheungF1.png 256w,/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/fa1df/CheungF1.png 512w,/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/f72f2/CheungF1.png 1024w\" alt=\"\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcSet=\"/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/94527/CheungF1.webp 256w,/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/d02ac/CheungF1.webp 512w,/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/bdd14/CheungF1.webp 1024w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"1\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/f72f2/CheungF1.png\" srcSet=\"/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/94b40/CheungF1.png 256w,/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/fa1df/CheungF1.png 512w,/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/f72f2/CheungF1.png 1024w\" alt=\"\"/></picture></noscript><script type=\"module\">const t=\"undefined\"!=typeof HTMLImageElement&&\"loading\"in HTMLImageElement.prototype;if(t){const t=document.querySelectorAll(\"img[data-main-image]\");for(let e of t){e.dataset.src&&(e.setAttribute(\"src\",e.dataset.src),e.removeAttribute(\"data-src\")),e.dataset.srcset&&(e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\"));const t=e.parentNode.querySelectorAll(\"source[data-srcset]\");for(let e of t)e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\");e.complete&&(e.style.opacity=1)}}</script></div><script type=\"application/json\" data-wp-inline-image-hydration=\"1\">{\"image\":{\"layout\":\"constrained\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#f8f8f8\",\"images\":{\"fallback\":{\"src\":\"/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/f72f2/CheungF1.png\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/94b40/CheungF1.png 256w,\\n/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/fa1df/CheungF1.png 512w,\\n/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/f72f2/CheungF1.png 1024w\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"},\"sources\":[{\"srcSet\":\"/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/94527/CheungF1.webp 256w,\\n/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/d02ac/CheungF1.webp 512w,\\n/static/822a65df5940caf3cf1e9a668fa12cce/bdd14/CheungF1.webp 1024w\",\"type\":\"image/webp\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"}]},\"width\":1024,\"height\":401},\"alt\":\"\",\"className\":\"wp-image-2839 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\",\"data-wp-inline-image\":\"1\"}</script><figcaption><strong>Fig 1 </strong>Experimental Timeline. ApoA-I KO and WT male and female animals underwent a single moderate-severe TBI at 2.5J. Brains from animals were harvested at 6hrs or 2 days (2D) post TBI for histological and cytokine analysis.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tissue Collection</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mice were fasted for 4 hours prior to anesthetization by intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg xylazine (Bayer, Whippany, NJ, USA) and 150 mg/kg ketamine (Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ, USA). Once a surgical plane of anesthesia was reached, mice were perfused for 7 min with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2500 U/L heparin at 6 mL/min. Brains were excised and bisected in the sagittal plane. Half of the brain used for biochemical analysis was snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until use. The remaining half-brain was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 2 days at 4°C followed by cryoprotection in 30% sucrose and 0.1% sodium azide at 4°C, after which 20-μm-thick coronal sections were cut using a cryotome (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cytokine ELISA</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Half-brain lysates were homogenized in 8-volumes of ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche, Branford, CT), and centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was extracted and frozen at −80 °C until analysis. Inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin-12 (1L-12), keratinocyte chemoattractant/ human growth-regulated oncogene (KC/GRO), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels were measured in RIPA lysates using MesoScale Discovery ELISA kit (K15048G, MesoScale Discovery, 1:2) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data points were interpolated from a standard curve and normalized to total soluble protein concentration measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermofisher, 23225) per the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Histology</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to visualize intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1) and their colocalization with endothelial cells (CD31). One section from the dorsal hippocampus and one section from the ventral hippocampus were selected from each cyrosectioned half-brain, which were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides. Antigen retrieval was performed with citrate buffer followed by washing with PBS, permeabilizing tissue with Triton, and blocking with 5% donkey serum, 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 60 minutes. Primary antibodies, ICAM-1 (R&amp;D, AF796, 1:50) and CD31 (Abcam,ab28364, 1:200) were incubated overnight at 4°C, followed by 3x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) washing steps. Next, incubation with secondary antibodies donkey anti-goat Alexa 594 (Invitrogen, A-11058, 1:400) and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 647 (Invitrogen, A-31573, 1:400), for ICAM-1 and CD31, respectively at room temperature for 2 hours. The samples were then washed 3x in PBS, cover-slipped and mounted onto slides in Prolong Gold Antifade with DAPI (Invitrogen, P36931). The slides were stored at 4°C until imaging with an Axio Scan.Z1 (Zeiss) slide scanner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Image analysis</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Entire coronal sections were imaged with Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY, USA) at 20× magnification, using fluorescent (ICAM/CD31) imaging. Downstream image analysis was performed with ImageJ (NIH)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A schematic of ICAM-1/CD31 quantification is illustrated in Figure 2. Exported images for each channel were converted to 8-bit black and white images. Cortical regions in the anterior hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex from the posterior hippocampus were drawn manually and saved as regions of interest (ROI) for each sample, using the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas as a guide. ICAM-1 signal was quantified by thresholding and reporting the percentage area containing signal relative to the total cortical area after filtering a background noise &lt;15 pixels. Stained vessels from the CD31 channel were selected with the ImageJ macro Tubeness. The outputs of Tubeness were thresholded and masked, after filtering of background noise &lt;100 pixels, CD31 percentage area was normalised to selected ROI areas. Vascular ICAM-1 was quantified as the ICAM-1 positive area associated with CD31 in each region where masks of the segmented CD31 image for a section were applied to the segmented ICAM-1 image of the same section, using the ImageJ macro ImageCalculator. The ICAM-1 positive area within the CD31 mask was measured then normalized to the total CD31-positive area within the ROI.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top\" class=\"gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper-constrained wp-image-2835 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" data-reactroot=\"\"><div style=\"max-width:657px;display:block\"><img alt=\"\" role=\"presentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height=&#x27;1024&#x27; width=&#x27;657&#x27; xmlns=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#x27; version=&#x27;1.1&#x27;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" style=\"max-width:100%;display:block;position:static\"/></div><div aria-hidden=\"true\" data-placeholder-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%\"></div><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" data-srcset=\"/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/a2ef3/CheungF4.webp 164w,/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/5cd93/CheungF4.webp 329w,/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/34f44/CheungF4.webp 657w,/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/ef827/CheungF4.webp 1314w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 657px) 657px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"2\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 657px) 657px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/c09b7/CheungF4.png\" data-srcset=\"/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/98ca0/CheungF4.png 164w,/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/ac885/CheungF4.png 329w,/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/c09b7/CheungF4.png 657w,/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/c4238/CheungF4.png 1314w\" alt=\"\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcSet=\"/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/a2ef3/CheungF4.webp 164w,/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/5cd93/CheungF4.webp 329w,/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/34f44/CheungF4.webp 657w,/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/ef827/CheungF4.webp 1314w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 657px) 657px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"2\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 657px) 657px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/c09b7/CheungF4.png\" srcSet=\"/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/98ca0/CheungF4.png 164w,/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/ac885/CheungF4.png 329w,/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/c09b7/CheungF4.png 657w,/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/c4238/CheungF4.png 1314w\" alt=\"\"/></picture></noscript><script type=\"module\">const t=\"undefined\"!=typeof HTMLImageElement&&\"loading\"in HTMLImageElement.prototype;if(t){const t=document.querySelectorAll(\"img[data-main-image]\");for(let e of t){e.dataset.src&&(e.setAttribute(\"src\",e.dataset.src),e.removeAttribute(\"data-src\")),e.dataset.srcset&&(e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\"));const t=e.parentNode.querySelectorAll(\"source[data-srcset]\");for(let e of t)e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\");e.complete&&(e.style.opacity=1)}}</script></div><script type=\"application/json\" data-wp-inline-image-hydration=\"2\">{\"image\":{\"layout\":\"constrained\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#f8f8f8\",\"images\":{\"fallback\":{\"src\":\"/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/c09b7/CheungF4.png\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/98ca0/CheungF4.png 164w,\\n/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/ac885/CheungF4.png 329w,\\n/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/c09b7/CheungF4.png 657w,\\n/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/c4238/CheungF4.png 1314w\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 657px) 657px, 100vw\"},\"sources\":[{\"srcSet\":\"/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/a2ef3/CheungF4.webp 164w,\\n/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/5cd93/CheungF4.webp 329w,\\n/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/34f44/CheungF4.webp 657w,\\n/static/fe9b0028de2350aaf5306a1b644aad87/ef827/CheungF4.webp 1314w\",\"type\":\"image/webp\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 657px) 657px, 100vw\"}]},\"width\":657,\"height\":1024},\"alt\":\"\",\"className\":\"wp-image-2835 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\",\"data-wp-inline-image\":\"2\"}</script><figcaption><strong>Fig 2</strong> TBI Induced increased Total ICAM-1 expression at the cerebral cortex in ApoA-I KO animals at 2D post Injury.

For the analysis of histological data, 3-way ANOVA was used considering ApoA-I genotype as one factor, injury status as another factor and timepoint of injury as the third factor, followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons test if significant factor or interaction effects were observed. For inflammatory cytokine assays, Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test was used to detect overall effect, followed by Bonferroni corrected Mann-Whitney test to detect meaningful between-group differences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Results</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>ApoA-I deficiency enhances the acute inflammatory response after CHIMERA TBI</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To assess differences in inflammatory status in brain tissue after TBI, we examined cytokine levels in RIPA brain lysates via Mesoscale cytokine ELISA. IL-6 and TNF-α are recognized markers of acute inflammation following TBI, and are produced by activated immune cells. KC/GRO is involved in neutrophil activation and subsequent activation of cells of the innate immune response. IL-12p70 is produced by dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils, and is involved in the activation of naïve T cells to activated T cells. We observed a significant overall effect in all four cytokines by Kruskal-Wallis analysis. Further, Bonferroni adjusted Mann–Whitney post-hoc analysis revealed a significant increase in IL-6 levels for both WT (p=0.002) and ApoA-I KO mice (p=0.008) at 6hr post TBI (Figure 3b). A trend for a significant injury driven increase was observed for WT TBI animals at 6hrs for KC/GRO, IL-12p70 and TNF- α (p=0.056), while no significant increase in measured cytokine levels was observed for ApoA-I KO animals at 6hrs (Figure 3a,c,d).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a significant decrease in cytokine levels between the WT 6hr TBI group and WT 2D TBI group (p=0.007) for KC/GRO, IL-12p70 and TNF- α (Figure 3a,c,d). No difference of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels between the WT sham and WT 2D TBI group could be detected (Figure 3a,c,d), suggesting that the inflammatory response was resolved by 2D in WT TBI mice. Intriguingly, the same pattern was not observed in ApoA-I KO mice as cytokine levels remained elevated between the 6hr TBI and 2D TBI group (p=0.456, p=1.000,p=0.368,p=0.368 for KC/GRO, IL-6, IL-12p70, and TNF-α respectively (Figure 3a-d). Of note, data points for pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in ApoA-I KO animals were higher and spread over a wider range compared to WT animals regardless of injury status (Figure 3a-d), suggesting a higher baseline cytokine level relative to WT. In addition, while no significant increase was observed in comparing the ApoA-I KO 2D TBI against the WT 2D TBI groups, there was a trend towards significance for KC/GRO (p=0.073), IL-12p70 (p=0.085),TNF-α (p=0.085) respectively (Figure 3a,c,d).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top\" class=\"gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper-constrained wp-image-2841 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" data-reactroot=\"\"><div style=\"max-width:428px;display:block\"><img alt=\"\" role=\"presentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height=&#x27;1023&#x27; width=&#x27;428&#x27; xmlns=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#x27; version=&#x27;1.1&#x27;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" style=\"max-width:100%;display:block;position:static\"/></div><div aria-hidden=\"true\" data-placeholder-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%\"></div><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" data-srcset=\"/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/c50dd/CheungF2.webp 107w,/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/3fde9/CheungF2.webp 214w,/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/04364/CheungF2.webp 428w,/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/35c0e/CheungF2.webp 856w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 428px) 428px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"3\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 428px) 428px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/005f6/CheungF2.png\" data-srcset=\"/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/f0f49/CheungF2.png 107w,/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/135c2/CheungF2.png 214w,/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/005f6/CheungF2.png 428w,/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/29b8d/CheungF2.png 856w\" alt=\"\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcSet=\"/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/c50dd/CheungF2.webp 107w,/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/3fde9/CheungF2.webp 214w,/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/04364/CheungF2.webp 428w,/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/35c0e/CheungF2.webp 856w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 428px) 428px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"3\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 428px) 428px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/005f6/CheungF2.png\" srcSet=\"/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/f0f49/CheungF2.png 107w,/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/135c2/CheungF2.png 214w,/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/005f6/CheungF2.png 428w,/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/29b8d/CheungF2.png 856w\" alt=\"\"/></picture></noscript><script type=\"module\">const t=\"undefined\"!=typeof HTMLImageElement&&\"loading\"in HTMLImageElement.prototype;if(t){const t=document.querySelectorAll(\"img[data-main-image]\");for(let e of t){e.dataset.src&&(e.setAttribute(\"src\",e.dataset.src),e.removeAttribute(\"data-src\")),e.dataset.srcset&&(e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\"));const t=e.parentNode.querySelectorAll(\"source[data-srcset]\");for(let e of t)e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\");e.complete&&(e.style.opacity=1)}}</script></div><script type=\"application/json\" data-wp-inline-image-hydration=\"3\">{\"image\":{\"layout\":\"constrained\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#f8f8f8\",\"images\":{\"fallback\":{\"src\":\"/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/005f6/CheungF2.png\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/f0f49/CheungF2.png 107w,\\n/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/135c2/CheungF2.png 214w,\\n/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/005f6/CheungF2.png 428w,\\n/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/29b8d/CheungF2.png 856w\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 428px) 428px, 100vw\"},\"sources\":[{\"srcSet\":\"/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/c50dd/CheungF2.webp 107w,\\n/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/3fde9/CheungF2.webp 214w,\\n/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/04364/CheungF2.webp 428w,\\n/static/c1e392e1ffd04b204f954bb6afbaf0d0/35c0e/CheungF2.webp 856w\",\"type\":\"image/webp\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 428px) 428px, 100vw\"}]},\"width\":428,\"height\":1023},\"alt\":\"\",\"className\":\"wp-image-2841 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\",\"data-wp-inline-image\":\"3\"}</script><figcaption><strong>Fig 3 </strong>Schematic diagram of quantification methods used for vascular immuno-positivity.

This temporal injury-recovery pattern, however, does not appear to be similar in ApoA-I KO animals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>ApoA-I deficiency increases injury driven total ICAM-1 positive area at the cortex at 2D post-TBI</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To better analyze specific brain areas affected by TBI, we examined the presence of inflammatory markers through immunofluorescence. ICAM-1 is an adhesion molecule produced by endothelial cells, astrocytes and microglia, and is a prominent marker for vascular inflammation as it promotes leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. We quantified the ICAM-1 signal in the entire cerebral cortex, spanning the retrosplenial area to the auditory areas where blood vessels are abundant, and observed a significant injury x genotype x timepoint effect (p=0.035) in total ICAM-1 area by 3-way ANOVA (Figure 4 a,c). Sidak adjusted post-hoc analysis revealed increased percentage stained total ICAM-1 between the 2D Sham ApoA-I KO and 2D TBI ApoA-I KO animals (p=0.001), from a mean of 0.343 to a mean of 0.981, while levels in WT animals remained consistent regardless of injury status or timepoint (p=0.863 for 6hr Sham WT vs 6hr TBI WT, p=0.935 for 2D Sham WT vs 2D TBI WT) (Figure 4c). In addition, although main group differences were not significant for vascular associated ICAM-1 (Figure 4c), there was a trend of increased vessel-associated ICAM-1 in 2D TBI ApoA-I KO animals compared to other groups. This finding demonstrated that, compared to WT animals, ApoA-I KO animals with TBI had a stronger induction of cortical ICAM-1, suggestive of a more pronounced inflammatory status. However, specific examination of the entorhinal cortex revealed no significant injury or genotype differences for both total ICAM-1 and vascular associated ICAM-1 in this region (Figure 4d). Together, these data suggest the potential for ApoA-I deficiency to exacerbate TBI-induced inflammation at the cerebral cortex at 2D, although more studies are needed to validate this preliminary observation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Discussion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an exploratory study of the potential role of ApoA-I in acute responses to TBI, with a pre-determined focus on cerebrovascular outcomes as ApoA-I is implicated in vascular contributions to Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease (AD).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our results provide proof-of-concept data that ApoA-I deficiency may alter the acute inflammatory response after moderate CHIMERA TBI. We observed a significant increase of cortical ICAM-1 total expression at 2D post-TBI for ApoA-I KO animals only (Figure 4), and an overall increase in cytokine levels independent of injury or timepoint status for ApoA-I KO animals (Figure 3). An increase in total ICAM-1 immunofluorescence was aligned with elevated cytokine levels observed in ApoA-I KO animals as cytokines can lead to endothelial activation, resulting in an increase in expression of adhesion factors (Lutton <em>et al</em>., 2017; Balabanov <em>et al</em>., 2001; McKeating &amp; Andrews, 1998). However, histological data suggest a highly regional-specific difference, as the increase in ICAM-1 expression was only observed in the cerebral cortex at the very acute timepoints studied, though this may be due to how the CHIMERA impact is made beneath the cerebral cortex. Since no baseline differences in ICAM-1 staining between ApoA-I KO and WT animals were observed in this study (Figure 4), ApoA-I deficiency may have a role in the inflammatory response during the recovery process after injury. Supporting this conclusion is the observation that ApoA-I KO animals did not follow the typical injury-recovery temporal response observed in WT animals (Figure 3). Notably, data points for cytokine levels in ApoA-I KO animals were spread over a wider range compared to WT animals regardless of injury status (Figure 3). This may imply that the higher variation in the ApoA-I KO group hindered detection of the cellular response to injury and subsequent recovery. Importantly, these results will need to be confirmed or refuted in future studies with additional animal numbers to provide more statistical power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top\" class=\"gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper-constrained wp-image-2843 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" data-reactroot=\"\"><div style=\"max-width:1024px;display:block\"><img alt=\"\" role=\"presentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height=&#x27;823.0000000000001&#x27; width=&#x27;1024&#x27; xmlns=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#x27; version=&#x27;1.1&#x27;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" style=\"max-width:100%;display:block;position:static\"/></div><div aria-hidden=\"true\" data-placeholder-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%\"></div><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" data-srcset=\"/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/9cfe5/CheungF3.webp 256w,/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/d5abe/CheungF3.webp 512w,/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/f33de/CheungF3.webp 1024w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"4\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/ce290/CheungF3.png\" data-srcset=\"/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/14c52/CheungF3.png 256w,/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/0e724/CheungF3.png 512w,/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/ce290/CheungF3.png 1024w\" alt=\"\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcSet=\"/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/9cfe5/CheungF3.webp 256w,/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/d5abe/CheungF3.webp 512w,/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/f33de/CheungF3.webp 1024w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"4\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/ce290/CheungF3.png\" srcSet=\"/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/14c52/CheungF3.png 256w,/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/0e724/CheungF3.png 512w,/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/ce290/CheungF3.png 1024w\" alt=\"\"/></picture></noscript><script type=\"module\">const t=\"undefined\"!=typeof HTMLImageElement&&\"loading\"in HTMLImageElement.prototype;if(t){const t=document.querySelectorAll(\"img[data-main-image]\");for(let e of t){e.dataset.src&&(e.setAttribute(\"src\",e.dataset.src),e.removeAttribute(\"data-src\")),e.dataset.srcset&&(e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\"));const t=e.parentNode.querySelectorAll(\"source[data-srcset]\");for(let e of t)e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\");e.complete&&(e.style.opacity=1)}}</script></div><script type=\"application/json\" data-wp-inline-image-hydration=\"4\">{\"image\":{\"layout\":\"constrained\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#f8f8f8\",\"images\":{\"fallback\":{\"src\":\"/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/ce290/CheungF3.png\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/14c52/CheungF3.png 256w,\\n/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/0e724/CheungF3.png 512w,\\n/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/ce290/CheungF3.png 1024w\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"},\"sources\":[{\"srcSet\":\"/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/9cfe5/CheungF3.webp 256w,\\n/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/d5abe/CheungF3.webp 512w,\\n/static/90890c64f5ea417be300c0498e5bbe42/f33de/CheungF3.webp 1024w\",\"type\":\"image/webp\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"}]},\"width\":1024,\"height\":823.0000000000001},\"alt\":\"\",\"className\":\"wp-image-2843 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\",\"data-wp-inline-image\":\"4\"}</script><figcaption><strong>Fig 4</strong> Altered cytokine profiles in ApoA-I KO animals.

This result is contradictory to what our group has observed in APP/PS1 mice, a common Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) animal model, where APP/PS1 mice deficient in ApoA-I had increased vascular ICAM-1 adhesion as well as increased vessel-associated astrogliosis when compared to APP/PS1 WT animals (Button et al., 2019). This may be due to the fact that APP/PS1 mice express and accumulate Aâ in the brain parenchyma and in cerebral vessels which triggers the production of increased ICAM-1 in the endothelial cells (Verbeek et al., 1994). Indeed, ICAM-1 is expressed in astrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells alike (Dietrich, 2002). Our results may imply that ApoA-I deficiency enhances ICAM-1 expression more robustly in glial cells rather than in endothelial cells following TBI in a WT mice background, which we used in this study. It will be important to determine whether ApoA-I deficiency and the presence of Aâ together exacerbates TBI-related pathologies, especially given the interest in understanding TBI in the vulnerable elderly population (Thompson et al., 2006; Haring et al., 2015).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This study has several limitations. We only examined very acute time points of 6hr and 2D.Future studies are encouraged to include post-acute and chronic time points up to 6 months after injury, when potential secondary damage to endothelial cells (Villalba <em>et al</em>., 2017; Andrews, Lutton, Merkel, Razmpour, &amp; Ramirez, 2016; Prakash &amp; Carmichael, 2015) may enable effects of ApoA-I deficiency to be more easily observed. Further, more time points are needed to investigate the extent of modulated cytokine response that we have observed in 2D TBI ApoA-I KO animals, as it is unclear whether this response will persist beyond the 2D timeframe (Figure 3).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these limitations, the study has several strengths, including the <em>a priori</em> blinding strategy used throughout. Based on the inflammatory changes presented thus far, future studies are encouraged to explore the mechanistic relationship between ApoA-I and neuroinflammation further, for example by supplementing ApoA-I KO TBI mice with HDL. To further characterize inflammatory outcomes observed in ApoA-I KO TBI mice, follow up work can be done to uncover transcriptomic changes induced by ApoA-I KO in the brain by techniques such as Single-Cell RNA-Seq (scRNAseq), which would help identify widespread changes in the brain beyond the capabilities of standard histology . Although this work is preliminary, our study shows that ApoA-I deficicency enhances acute inflammatory responses post a single CHIMERA TBI.The results from this study raises the possibility that ApoA-I supplementation may be of therapeutic value in TBI patients.,and shows how additional research in this area would be beneficial in advancing TBI treatment.</p>\n","uri":"/apoa-i-deficiency-enhances-acute-inflammatory-responses-after-experimental-traumatic-brain-injury/","articleMetadata":{"articleData":{"abstract":"Cerebral vascular injury is a common phenomenon after traumatic brain injury (TBI), with complications including vascular inflammation, decreased cerebral blood flow, and increased vessel tortuosity. Promoting cerebrovascular health may therefore be a useful therapeutic intervention after TBI. ApoA-I, the major protein constituent of circulating high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are an attractive target due to its vasoprotective and anti-inflammatory roles in periphery vessels, but little is known on whether these benefits extend to the brain. To address this gap in knowledge, this study was designed to test the novel hypothesis that ApoA-I deficiency would worsen acute vascular and inflammatory outcomes in mice after Closed-Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) TBI. ApoA-I Knockout (ApoA-I KO) and WT mice underwent single moderate-severe TBI. Histopathological outcomes at 6hr and 2 days (2D) post-injury were assessed. ApoA-I KO mice exhibited greater Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1), a marker for vascular permeability, in the cortex at 2D post-TBI compared to WT controls, and a subtle increase in brain pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.

Over the past 50 years, the 5-year survival rate for childhood cancer (ages 0-14) has significantly increased by 40% in the United States due to improved therapy and supportive care. Nevertheless, the same progress is not seen for adolescent patients (ages 15-19). This is the “Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survival Gap”, which is observed in the US and Canada and can be attributed to a combination of adolescent cancer biology, varying responses to treatment, and a lack of enrolment in clinical trials (Bleyer, 2005; Pollock, 2007). The site of adolescent cancer treatment matters because paediatric centres often place greater emphasis on clinical trial participation and provide greater psychosocial support for adolescents, which can ultimately lead to better survival outcomes (Pollock, 2007; Brand et al., 2016). In British Columbia, the BC Children’s Hospital (BCCH) is the only children’s oncology treatment centre; therefore, the first aim of this study investigates where adolescents with cancer are receiving their treatment and what factors influence those referral patterns that ensure best treatment practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More specifically to BC, adolescent patients living in the northern and southern interior may experience greater constraints in accessing care due to longer travel times to BCCH and the scarcity of care providers. Travel impedance has been known to be a controlling factor in the utilization of health care systems (Kanaroglou et al., 2016). Thus, the second aim of this study investigates whether driving time influences referral decisions for adolescent cancer patients in BC. Such an approach encompasses the perspective of health geography, where patients’ locations can impede access to cancer treatment centres. Currently, there is no specialized adolescent cancer treatment unit nor universal guidelines for adolescent treatment at either paediatric or adult cancer centres in Canada or the US (Albritton &amp; Bleyer, 2003).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This study analysed data from 1995 to 2010 because the patient data up to 2010 was the most complete, comprehensive, and readily available. Despite the data being more than a decade old, the study on adolescent cancer patients’ accessibility is one of the first in British Columbia. Moreover, the “Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survival Gap” still occurs across Canada and there still lacks systematic guidelines on how adolescent cancer patients should be referred and medical subspecialties that specifically treat adolescent cancer patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-7cd11eaf-7a3f-4a8c-8ba2-9ff714db30b2\">Methods</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Data source</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The patient data was collected from the Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer Survivors Research Program (CAYACS) by the BC Cancer Research Agency. The CAYACS program is a longitudinal cohort study that follows children and adolescent cancer patients from their initial diagnoses (McBride et al., 2010). Consent for personal data was given by the BC Cancer Research Agency via a confidentiality agreement. This dataset included all individuals diagnosed with cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) between ages 15-18 inclusive (n= 616) from 1995 to 2010, who are BC residents at the time of diagnosis and survived at least one month from the diagnosis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this study, all BCCA centres were defined as adult centres (Vancouver Centre, Vancouver Island Centre, Fraser Valley Centre, Southern Interior Centre, Abbotsford Centre) while BCCH was the paediatric treatment centre. Between 1995 and 2010, the Southern Interior Centre was opened 3 April 1998 and the Abbotsford Centre was opened 25 August 2008. The Northern Centre was excluded from this study because it was opened in 2012. Therefore, the patient dataset was categorized as 1 January 1995 to 2 April 1998; 3 April 1998 to 24 August 2008; and 25 August 2008 to 31 December 2010.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Geocoding</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The hospital locations were geocoded using the “Geocode Addresses Tool” in ArcGIS and the address locator was provided by the DMTI Route Logistic package. The DMTI Postal Code Suite contained polygon files of local delivery units (LDU) in BC that consist of 6-digit postal codes. Patient data was geocoded to the corresponding LDU.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Road network dataset</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The road network dataset was created using the Network Analyst extension in ArcGIS from the DMTI Route Logistics package as a necessary procedure to produce driving times.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Driving time</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Driving time of each patient to the closest cancer treatment centres was calculated using the OD cost matrix from the ArcGIS Network Analyst extension. In the driving time output, every patient had driving times to every centre calculated and ranked from shortest to longest. The shortest driving time to any centre indicated the closest facility for that patient.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Driving map</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To visualize the driving times to the closest cancer treatment centre for patients in BC, aggregated dissemination areas (ADA) from Statistics Canada were used as the patient data was too small to represent the driving time for the entire province and spatial interpolation would not be accurate. After driving times were calculated for each ADA; driving time was categorized as falling within 1 hour, 1-2 hours, 2-5 hours, 5-10 hours, or 10+ hours (Figs. 1, 2, 3).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top\" class=\"gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper-constrained wp-image-2857 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" data-reactroot=\"\"><div style=\"max-width:791px;display:block\"><img alt=\"\" role=\"presentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height=&#x27;1024&#x27; width=&#x27;791&#x27; xmlns=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#x27; version=&#x27;1.1&#x27;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" style=\"max-width:100%;display:block;position:static\"/></div><div aria-hidden=\"true\" data-placeholder-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%\"></div><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" data-srcset=\"/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/0145a/LiF1-scaled.webp 198w,/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/5810d/LiF1-scaled.webp 396w,/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/f77bd/LiF1-scaled.webp 791w,/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/af447/LiF1-scaled.webp 1582w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 791px) 791px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"1\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 791px) 791px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/2466f/LiF1-scaled.jpg\" data-srcset=\"/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/76004/LiF1-scaled.jpg 198w,/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/a6b83/LiF1-scaled.jpg 396w,/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/2466f/LiF1-scaled.jpg 791w,/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/6571c/LiF1-scaled.jpg 1582w\" alt=\"\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcSet=\"/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/0145a/LiF1-scaled.webp 198w,/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/5810d/LiF1-scaled.webp 396w,/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/f77bd/LiF1-scaled.webp 791w,/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/af447/LiF1-scaled.webp 1582w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 791px) 791px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"1\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 791px) 791px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/2466f/LiF1-scaled.jpg\" srcSet=\"/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/76004/LiF1-scaled.jpg 198w,/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/a6b83/LiF1-scaled.jpg 396w,/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/2466f/LiF1-scaled.jpg 791w,/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/6571c/LiF1-scaled.jpg 1582w\" alt=\"\"/></picture></noscript><script type=\"module\">const t=\"undefined\"!=typeof HTMLImageElement&&\"loading\"in HTMLImageElement.prototype;if(t){const t=document.querySelectorAll(\"img[data-main-image]\");for(let e of t){e.dataset.src&&(e.setAttribute(\"src\",e.dataset.src),e.removeAttribute(\"data-src\")),e.dataset.srcset&&(e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\"));const t=e.parentNode.querySelectorAll(\"source[data-srcset]\");for(let e of t)e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\");e.complete&&(e.style.opacity=1)}}</script></div><script type=\"application/json\" data-wp-inline-image-hydration=\"1\">{\"image\":{\"layout\":\"constrained\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#f8f8f8\",\"images\":{\"fallback\":{\"src\":\"/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/2466f/LiF1-scaled.jpg\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/76004/LiF1-scaled.jpg 198w,\\n/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/a6b83/LiF1-scaled.jpg 396w,\\n/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/2466f/LiF1-scaled.jpg 791w,\\n/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/6571c/LiF1-scaled.jpg 1582w\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 791px) 791px, 100vw\"},\"sources\":[{\"srcSet\":\"/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/0145a/LiF1-scaled.webp 198w,\\n/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/5810d/LiF1-scaled.webp 396w,\\n/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/f77bd/LiF1-scaled.webp 791w,\\n/static/f4b7e27b6eeee0b35ec292a9361d045e/af447/LiF1-scaled.webp 1582w\",\"type\":\"image/webp\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 791px) 791px, 100vw\"}]},\"width\":791,\"height\":1024},\"alt\":\"\",\"className\":\"wp-image-2857 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\",\"data-wp-inline-image\":\"1\"}</script><figcaption><strong>Fig 1 </strong>Driving time to the closest cancer centre for adolescents in BC between 1995 to 1998.

Table 1 highlights the distribution of referral to every cancer treatment centre in BC based on age, income, rurality, regional health authority catchment, seasonality, and diagnosis groups. Overall, 59% of patients were referred to BCCA and 27% were referred to BCCH. Among BCCA referrals, 30% of patients were referred to the Vancouver centre and only 6% were referred to the Southern Interior centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The univariate logistics regression models (Table 2) showed that only age and diagnosis groups including leukaemia, CNS, germ cell, and thyroid carcinoma had a statistically significant impact on referral. 63% of older adolescents were referred to BCCA while 80% of younger adolescents were referred to BCCH. This showed that patients between ages 17-18 were less likely than patients between ages 15-16 to be referred to paediatric centres (OR 0.14, P= &lt;2e-16) which is the most expected result similar to previous studies (Table 2).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although referrals to BCCA and BCCH seem to be evenly distributed between ICCC diagnosis, leukaemia and CNS patients were more likely than all other patients to be referred to BCCH (OR 2.23, P=0.0013; OR 2.42, P= 0.0014). Germ cell and thyroid carcinoma are both less likely than all other diagnoses to be referred to BCCH (OR 0.39, P= 0.0029; OR 0.27, P= 0.0348). Sarcoma patients were more likely to be referred to BCCH but not with statistical significance whereas lymphoma patients were less likely to be referred to BCCH based on the odds ratio (Table 2).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patients of higher SES, urban locality, and who were closer to BCCH were more likely to be referred to BCCH but not with statistical significance. The overall referral characteristics showed that referral based on neighbourhood income quintile was evenly distributed across all centres. Referral to the Southern Interior centre consisted of 54% urban and 46% non-urban patients whereas referral to all other centres consisted of mostly urban patients. Additionally, whether a patient received radiotherapy treatment did not affect whether a patient was treated at BCCH.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The multivariate logistic regression model tested for the combined effect of all the modifiers on referral to BCCA or BCCH (Table 3). The model showed that age was the only factor that impacted referral to BCCA or BCCH after all the factors were accounted for (OR 0.13, P &lt; 2e-16).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Driving time and referral</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fig. 1, 2, 3 visualized the overall distribution of driving time to the closest cancer centre across BC. From 1995 to 1998, the driving time was shortest for patients living the Vancouver lower mainland where which was within 1 hour of their closest treatment centre, gradually increasing as one moves away to other parts of BC. This is expected as there were three treatment centres (Vancouver centre, Fraser Valley centre and BC Children’s) in the area, easing access to those three facilities for patients living there, translating to shorter driving times. Since the opening of the Southern Interior centre in 1998, driving time for patients in that area significantly decreased as indicated by the dark green cluster in Fig. 2. Nonetheless, driving time for patients in all the other parts of BC remained relatively the same. After the Abbotsford centre opened in 2008, the dark green region expanded further north and east from the Vancouver lower mainland, which shows that more patients had access to a cancer centre within 1 hour of driving time (Fig. 3). However, minimal change was observed in other parts of BC since the Abbotsford centre is still within the Fraser Valley, and often acts as an overflow centre to complement the Fraser Valley Centre in Surrey. The opening of the Southern Interior and Abbotsford centre shows that access to cancer treatment centre improved only locally. Between 1995 and 2010, 61% of patients were not referred to their closest treatment centre and only 35% were. As driving time increased, the patient’s referred centre was less likely to be their closest treatment centre (OR 0.995, P= 1.9e-10).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-2767c97d-d9a0-4609-8fc2-65db7890d30c\">Discussion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since older adolescents were less likely than younger adolescents to be referred to BCCH, age was one of the most important factors influencing referral which showed that older adolescents still had limited access to BCCH. This result is consistent with the lower referral rate to paediatric centres for patients aged 18-19 compared to those aged 15-17 according to a 2004 study by the Canadian Childhood Cancer Surveillance and Control Program (Klein-Geltink et al., 2004). To illustrate the effect of age on referral, the multivariate logistic regression also demonstrated that age was the only factor that had a statistically significant impact on referral when all the tested factors were combined.<br>Similarly, studies in North Carolina, Washington State, Georgia and Ohio found that referral to paediatric centres significantly decreased as adolescent age increases from 15 to 19 (Gordon et al., 2018; Howell et al., 2007; Yeager, et al., 2006). The contributing factor could be the physician conducting the referral: for example, although there is no defined age limit for adolescents to be treated at BCCH, there might still be a “perceived age limit” by the physician even though it might be beneficial for patients in their early 20s to be referred to paediatric centres (Gordon et al., 2018). Moreover, paediatric primary care physicians (PCP) were more likely to refer their patients to paediatric centres if they had colleagues that they personally knew working in these centres (Gordon et al., 2018).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Older adolescents living in rural areas of BC might prefer a BCCA centre because it is geographically closer and they can drive themselves to the treatment sessions despite the more specialized care provided in BCCH (Albritton et al., 2007). Older adolescent patients might also be reluctant to receive treatment at BCCH because they do not want to be perceived as children and want to be more connected to their peers who are also entering adulthood (Albritton et al., 2007; Howell et al., 2017; Klein-Geltink et al., 2005). The result showed that as driving time increased, adolescent patients were less likely to be referred to their closest centre, which can benefit rural patients. Since the driving time to their closest BCCA might be just as far as BCCH, families might choose BCCH instead due to better treatment options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, improved survival outcomes were seen at the paediatric centre because they provided supportive care more tailored towards the emotional needs of adolescents and inpatient care which improves survival outcomes in cases of adverse complications (Howell et al., 2007). More importantly, lack of access to BCCH for these older adolescents might suggest lack of enrolment in clinical trials, which may significantly impact their survival outcome (Parsons et al., 2015).<br>Referral was also influenced by diagnosis. Leukaemia (all subgroups) and CNS tumour patients were more likely than patients with other cancers to be referred to BCCH. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, 68.2% of average annual incidence per million of leukaemia from 1975-2000 occurred in children less than 5 years old (Bleyer et al., 2006). Similarly, higher incidence of CNS tumours was seen in children under 5 (33.7%) compared to adolescents between ages 15-19 (19.2%). This suggests that adolescent patients with cancer more commonly seen in younger children are more likely to be referred to BCCH. This is important when considering the survival outcome of referrals because the 5-year survival rate for leukaemia is often lower when it is not treated at paediatric centres (Howell et al., 2007).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patients diagnosed with germ cell and thyroid carcinoma were less likely to be referred to BCCH and both cancers were more common in the older teens than in younger children according to the SEER Program (Bleyer et al., 2006). Those patients diagnosed with germ cell and thyroid carcinoma may also be seen by physicians with surgical specialties, which decreases their chances of being referred to BCCH (Albritton et al., 2007; Parsons et al., 2015).<br>Other ICCC diagnoses also affect referral but not with statistical significance. Bone tumours and soft tissue sarcomas are more likely to be treated at a paediatric centre where survival for patients with those cancers is usually favored (Howell et al., 2007). Lymphoma patients are less likely to be referred to BCCH, which is surprising because lymphoma is usually considered a more “paediatric-specific cancer” (Bleyer et al., 2006). This suggests a potentially unfavourable survival outcome for those lymphoma patients treated at BCCA, since survival may improve when they are treated at BCCH instead (Parsons et al., 2015). Furthermore, SES, rurality, seasonality, and distance to BCCH, which are internally correlated factors, did not influence referral with statistical significance. Since lower SES and rural patients are expected to have less accessibility to BCCH, the logistic regression showed that referral patterns were in fact not as affected by those factors than by age and diagnosis. This reflects health care access equality in British Columbia under the premise of this study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of greater implication for referral location is the patient’s potential survival rate. Each category of adolescent cancer has biologically distinct characteristics and thus requires careful consideration of whether an adult or paediatric center will be better suited for a particular patient (Wolfson et al., 2014). There are major benefits when treated is received at a paediatric centre, such as participation in clinical trials, peer support, and better follow-up care (De et al., 2011). Given the uniqueness of adolescent cancer, referral decisions are often complex and there is no “one size fits all” solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-c9976c6d-9db6-48bb-b4fb-d836cc488133\">Conclusions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This study suggests that patients who were younger, of higher SES, urban, suffered from lymphoma, sarcoma, without radiotherapy, not traveling in the winter, and located farther from an adult centre would be more likely to be referred to BCCH. More specifically, age and diagnosis were the two major factors affecting adolescent cancer patient referrals in British Columbia. From a physician’s perspective, the awareness that older adolescents might be better treated at paediatric centres is critical (Yeager et al., 2006). Additional systematic efforts should also be implemented such as developing hospital policies that facilitate the appropriate referral based on each adolescent’s age and diagnosis, and improving access to these appropriately referred treatment centres to further reduce the AYA cancer gap (Gordon et al., 2018; Parsons et al., 2015). Currently, the Adolescent and Young Adult Committee has prioritized the identification of new treatment protocols tailored towards treating adolescent cancer, improving psychosocial support during therapy, and increasing the participation in clinical trials (Pollock, 2007).<br>It should be noted that referral location may differ from where patients actually receive treatment, because such data is not available through the CAYACS program. Nonetheless, this study contributed insights on access to adolescent cancer care in BC, with the additional dimension of driving time. This can also be considered in the planning of another paediatric hospital or cancer centre in other parts of BC, while further informing paediatric and adult oncologists about referral and survival patterns. Since the Northern BC Centre was omitted in this study due to the limited dataset timeline, this project should be repeated when data after 2012 becomes available. Furthermore, the two studies could be compared to analyze whether the Northern centre increased accessibility to care and survival for adolescents living in Northern BC. As a critical next step to this study, the 5-year survival outcome for this cohort and enrolment in clinical trials based on referral difference should also be examined.</p>\n","uri":"/adolescent-cancer-patient-referral-patterns-in-british-columbia/","articleMetadata":{"articleData":{"abstract":"Recent studies have suggested that adolescent cancer may have better survival outcomes when treated at paediatric centres, which better emphasize enrolment in clinical trials and have more capacity to support the social and emotional needs of adolescents.

Between 1995 and 2010, only 27% of adolescent cancer patients in BC were referred to the BCCH, the only paediatric oncology centre in BC. Rural patients might have limited accessibility to BCCH, despite referral, due to travel restrictions and costs. As a result, patients are less likely to be referred to their closest cancer treatment centre as driving time increases (OR 0.995, P= 1.9e-10). Odds ratios of each modifier to BCCA or BCCH were calculated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models in R Studio 3.5.1. Overall, 80% of younger adolescent (age 15-16) were referred to BCCH and only 14% of older adolescents (age 17-18) were referred to BCCH, which suggested that older adolescents were less likely than younger adolescents to be referred to BCCH (P= <2e-16). Additionally, leukaemia and Central Nervous System (CNS) cancer patients were more likely than all other patients to be referred to BCCH (P= 0.0014). The study of referral patterns is an essential factor when determining adolescent cancer survival rate.","pdfLink":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/00800aa9ec5a1523aa3d049a95485c4d/52-Li.pdf"}},"citation":"Li, A.

Traditional wildlife survey methods such as scat and track transects can be expensive and time-consuming, and often result in misidentification or failure to detect species, hampering conservation efforts (Mackenzie, 2005). It is therefore important to select appropriate survey methods that avoid these biases (Miller, Nichols, McClintock, Campbell Grant, Bailey, &amp; Weir, 2011). Wildlife cameras overcome some of these shortcomings by collecting data continuously over a long period of time and by easing photographic identification of wildlife, thereby increasing the survey period and reducing the probability of detection error (Vine, Crowther, Lapige, Dickman, Mooney, Piggot, &amp; English, 2009). Vine et al. (2009) compared camera traps, hair traps, scat from bait stations, and spotlighting to determine the best survey method for a low-density red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) population and found that camera traps provided the most consistent and univocal results, minimizing bias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these benefits, wildlife cameras have performance limitations and not all wildlife cameras perform equally (Meek, Ballard, &amp; Fleming, 2015). Broadly speaking, there are performance disparities between “professional” and “recreational” camera models. Professional models are designed for research and incorporate higher-quality components (e.g.: sensors, camera lens, etc.), have more customization options, and are thus more expensive, whereas recreational models are intended for use by the general public and have limited features, resulting in a more affordable and user-friendly product (Newey, Davidson, Nazir, Fairhurst, Verdicchio, Irvine, &amp; van der Wal, 2015). One study completed by Newey et al. (2015) found that recreational camera models are less reliable than professional models and produced a greater number of false positive (blank) images and false negative (missed detection) data. A false positive occurs when a camera takes a photo in the absence of wildlife. False positives can present issues because they consume memory, batteries, and time processing images (Heiniger &amp; Gillespie, 2018). Newey et al. (2015) also note that recreational cameras are prone to malfunction, which also take up memory and drain batteries, possibly leading to data loss. For the purposes of this study, a malfunction is defined as an image that is colour-stained (Figure 1). Sometimes, wildlife can be identified from malfunctioned images, but in more serious malfunctions, the colour stain completely blocks the image, making identification impossible, as seen in Figure 1B.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top\" class=\"gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper-constrained wp-image-2893 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" data-reactroot=\"\"><div style=\"max-width:1024px;display:block\"><img alt=\"\" role=\"presentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height=&#x27;384&#x27; width=&#x27;1024&#x27; xmlns=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#x27; version=&#x27;1.1&#x27;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" style=\"max-width:100%;display:block;position:static\"/></div><div aria-hidden=\"true\" data-placeholder-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%\"></div><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" data-srcset=\"/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/6e381/PizanteF1.webp 256w,/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/bdf76/PizanteF1.webp 512w,/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/2cfbf/PizanteF1.webp 1024w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"1\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/50609/PizanteF1.png\" data-srcset=\"/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/a255e/PizanteF1.png 256w,/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/258ce/PizanteF1.png 512w,/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/50609/PizanteF1.png 1024w\" alt=\"\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcSet=\"/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/6e381/PizanteF1.webp 256w,/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/bdf76/PizanteF1.webp 512w,/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/2cfbf/PizanteF1.webp 1024w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"1\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/50609/PizanteF1.png\" srcSet=\"/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/a255e/PizanteF1.png 256w,/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/258ce/PizanteF1.png 512w,/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/50609/PizanteF1.png 1024w\" alt=\"\"/></picture></noscript><script type=\"module\">const t=\"undefined\"!=typeof HTMLImageElement&&\"loading\"in HTMLImageElement.prototype;if(t){const t=document.querySelectorAll(\"img[data-main-image]\");for(let e of t){e.dataset.src&&(e.setAttribute(\"src\",e.dataset.src),e.removeAttribute(\"data-src\")),e.dataset.srcset&&(e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\"));const t=e.parentNode.querySelectorAll(\"source[data-srcset]\");for(let e of t)e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\");e.complete&&(e.style.opacity=1)}}</script></div><script type=\"application/json\" data-wp-inline-image-hydration=\"1\">{\"image\":{\"layout\":\"constrained\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#082808\",\"images\":{\"fallback\":{\"src\":\"/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/50609/PizanteF1.png\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/a255e/PizanteF1.png 256w,\\n/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/258ce/PizanteF1.png 512w,\\n/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/50609/PizanteF1.png 1024w\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"},\"sources\":[{\"srcSet\":\"/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/6e381/PizanteF1.webp 256w,\\n/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/bdf76/PizanteF1.webp 512w,\\n/static/6ba180556d9204dd610e25d68afb7b28/2cfbf/PizanteF1.webp 1024w\",\"type\":\"image/webp\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"}]},\"width\":1024,\"height\":384},\"alt\":\"\",\"className\":\"wp-image-2893 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\",\"data-wp-inline-image\":\"1\"}</script><figcaption><strong>Fig 1</strong> Two examples of a malfunction image collected from a Spypoint Solar Trail camera.

While countless studies have used wildlife cameras, few have considered the differences between models (Rovero, Zimmermann, Berzi, &amp; Meek, 2013; Trolliet et al., 2013; Meek et al., 2015). A study will typically use only one model, so it is imperative that the selected camera has the minimum specifications required to fulfil the study’s needs. There can also be substantial variation between different units of the same model (Hughson, Darby, &amp; Dungan, 2010), as camera set-up, settings, and the quantity of cameras used can alter the likelihood of detecting certain species (Rovero et al., 2013; Wellington, Bottom, Merrill, &amp; Litvaitis, 2014; Meek, Ballard, &amp; Falzon, 2016). Therefore, it is crucial that researchers consider not only which model, but also which settings to use (Driessen, Jarman, Troy, &amp; Callander, 2017).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of this study is to examine differences between two wildlife camera models, the Spypoint Solar Trail and Reconyx Hyperfire 2, on behalf of Calgary Captured. Calgary Captured is a collaborative project between the City of Calgary and the Miistakis Institute to determine wildlife occupancy in Calgary’s Natural Area Parks using wildlife cameras (Miistakis Institute, 2017). Initially, Calgary Captured used Spypoint Solar Trail cameras, a recreational model as stated by its manual. However, after a period of two years, Calgary Captured began using the Reconyx Hyperfire 2, a professional model, following concerns from Calgary Captured over potential false negatives produced by the Spypoint models (Nicole Kahal, pers. comm.). It is important to understand the variation in performance between these different camera models to avoid making inaccurate conclusions about their results (Heiniger &amp; Gillespie, 2018). Therefore, this study quantifies the difference in detection efficacy between the two models so that the Calgary Captured project can compare the data collected by the Spypoint cameras with those collected by the Reconyx cameras.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Study area</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>10 Spypoint and 10 Reconyx wildlife cameras were placed in pairs at 10 sites: four sites in Weaselhead Flats (Figure 2A), one site in North Glenmore Park (Figure 2A), and five sites in Fish Creek Provincial Park (Figure 2B). Weaselhead Flats and North Glenmore Park are adjacent to each other, and Fish Creek Provincial Park is located approximately 15 km southeast of Weaselhead Flats. All the parks used in this study have similar habitats consisting of riparian zones and aspen poplar, balsam poplar, and white spruce forest. The sites used for this experiment are 10 of the existing 69 Calgary Captured camera sites, which are systematically located near game trails and away from human trails in a 1km by 1km grid, except in Weaselhead Flats, where additional cameras were placed by Calgary Captured, resulting in a higher camera density (N. Kahal, pers. comm.).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top\" class=\"gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper-constrained wp-image-2897 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" data-reactroot=\"\"><div style=\"max-width:1024px;display:block\"><img alt=\"\" role=\"presentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height=&#x27;364&#x27; width=&#x27;1024&#x27; xmlns=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#x27; version=&#x27;1.1&#x27;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" style=\"max-width:100%;display:block;position:static\"/></div><div aria-hidden=\"true\" data-placeholder-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%\"></div><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" data-srcset=\"/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/49e62/PizanteF2.webp 256w,/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/8c65c/PizanteF2.webp 512w,/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/0d582/PizanteF2.webp 1024w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"2\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/50b2d/PizanteF2.png\" data-srcset=\"/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/f0deb/PizanteF2.png 256w,/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/3f843/PizanteF2.png 512w,/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/50b2d/PizanteF2.png 1024w\" alt=\"\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcSet=\"/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/49e62/PizanteF2.webp 256w,/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/8c65c/PizanteF2.webp 512w,/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/0d582/PizanteF2.webp 1024w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"2\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/50b2d/PizanteF2.png\" srcSet=\"/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/f0deb/PizanteF2.png 256w,/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/3f843/PizanteF2.png 512w,/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/50b2d/PizanteF2.png 1024w\" alt=\"\"/></picture></noscript><script type=\"module\">const t=\"undefined\"!=typeof HTMLImageElement&&\"loading\"in HTMLImageElement.prototype;if(t){const t=document.querySelectorAll(\"img[data-main-image]\");for(let e of t){e.dataset.src&&(e.setAttribute(\"src\",e.dataset.src),e.removeAttribute(\"data-src\")),e.dataset.srcset&&(e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\"));const t=e.parentNode.querySelectorAll(\"source[data-srcset]\");for(let e of t)e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\");e.complete&&(e.style.opacity=1)}}</script></div><script type=\"application/json\" data-wp-inline-image-hydration=\"2\">{\"image\":{\"layout\":\"constrained\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#f8f8f8\",\"images\":{\"fallback\":{\"src\":\"/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/50b2d/PizanteF2.png\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/f0deb/PizanteF2.png 256w,\\n/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/3f843/PizanteF2.png 512w,\\n/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/50b2d/PizanteF2.png 1024w\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"},\"sources\":[{\"srcSet\":\"/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/49e62/PizanteF2.webp 256w,\\n/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/8c65c/PizanteF2.webp 512w,\\n/static/48e12ec479467d8d88775dbea316e519/0d582/PizanteF2.webp 1024w\",\"type\":\"image/webp\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw\"}]},\"width\":1024,\"height\":364},\"alt\":\"\",\"className\":\"wp-image-2897 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\",\"data-wp-inline-image\":\"2\"}</script><figcaption><strong>Fig  2 (a)</strong> Google Earth image of camera sites in Weaselhead Flats (61, 62, 63, and 64) and North Glenmore Park (66); <strong>(b)</strong> Google Earth image of cameras sites in Fish Creek Provincial Park (39, 43, 44, 45, and 46).</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Camera set-up</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One Spypoint Solar Trail camera and one Reconyx Hyperfire 2 camera were placed together at each site. An ideal setup would place both cameras within 1 m directly next to each other (Hughson et al., 2010; Meek et al., 2015). However, there was rarely a pair of neighbouring trees close enough to allow for this setup. As a consequence, both cameras were placed on the same tree at nine sites, with the Spypoint camera placed above the Reconyx camera so that the Spypoint’s solar panel would not be obstructed by the Reconyx camera (Figure 3A). Site 62 was the exception and the cameras there were placed on neighbouring trees (Figure 3B). Camera height was measured by distance from the centre of the Fresnel lens to the ground (Table 1). Information on the specifications and settings of the cameras used in this study can be found in Table 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top\" class=\"gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper-constrained wp-image-2901 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" data-reactroot=\"\"><div style=\"max-width:945px;display:block\"><img alt=\"\" role=\"presentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height=&#x27;594&#x27; width=&#x27;945&#x27; xmlns=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#x27; version=&#x27;1.1&#x27;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" style=\"max-width:100%;display:block;position:static\"/></div><div aria-hidden=\"true\" data-placeholder-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%\"></div><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" data-srcset=\"/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/2b5b2/PizanteF3.webp 236w,/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/227ee/PizanteF3.webp 473w,/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/e49c6/PizanteF3.webp 945w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 945px) 945px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"3\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 945px) 945px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/fe60a/PizanteF3.png\" data-srcset=\"/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/aa0af/PizanteF3.png 236w,/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/747a2/PizanteF3.png 473w,/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/fe60a/PizanteF3.png 945w\" alt=\"\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcSet=\"/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/2b5b2/PizanteF3.webp 236w,/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/227ee/PizanteF3.webp 473w,/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/e49c6/PizanteF3.webp 945w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 945px) 945px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"3\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 945px) 945px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/fe60a/PizanteF3.png\" srcSet=\"/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/aa0af/PizanteF3.png 236w,/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/747a2/PizanteF3.png 473w,/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/fe60a/PizanteF3.png 945w\" alt=\"\"/></picture></noscript><script type=\"module\">const t=\"undefined\"!=typeof HTMLImageElement&&\"loading\"in HTMLImageElement.prototype;if(t){const t=document.querySelectorAll(\"img[data-main-image]\");for(let e of t){e.dataset.src&&(e.setAttribute(\"src\",e.dataset.src),e.removeAttribute(\"data-src\")),e.dataset.srcset&&(e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\"));const t=e.parentNode.querySelectorAll(\"source[data-srcset]\");for(let e of t)e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\");e.complete&&(e.style.opacity=1)}}</script></div><script type=\"application/json\" data-wp-inline-image-hydration=\"3\">{\"image\":{\"layout\":\"constrained\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#f8f8f8\",\"images\":{\"fallback\":{\"src\":\"/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/fe60a/PizanteF3.png\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/aa0af/PizanteF3.png 236w,\\n/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/747a2/PizanteF3.png 473w,\\n/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/fe60a/PizanteF3.png 945w\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 945px) 945px, 100vw\"},\"sources\":[{\"srcSet\":\"/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/2b5b2/PizanteF3.webp 236w,\\n/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/227ee/PizanteF3.webp 473w,\\n/static/dc8685ec843d622bcedbd2108914178a/e49c6/PizanteF3.webp 945w\",\"type\":\"image/webp\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 945px) 945px, 100vw\"}]},\"width\":945,\"height\":594},\"alt\":\"\",\"className\":\"wp-image-2901 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\",\"data-wp-inline-image\":\"3\"}</script><figcaption><strong>Fig 3 (a) </strong>Example of camera placement at 9/10 sites (all except site 62, <strong>(b)</strong>).</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Data collection and processing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Memory card collection took place once a week, alternating between the Fish Creek Provincial Park sites and the Weaselhead Flats/North Glenmore Park sites. As a control measure, and to quantify false negatives, “walk-bys” were performed each time a camera was checked, during which the principal researcher walked past each camera three times, each time at three different speeds: slow (0.5m/s-0.6m/s), medium (0.9m/s-1.3m/s), and fast (1.5m/s-3.1m/s). This procedure was not performed at sites 43, 44, and 61 due to safety concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The images captured by the cameras were processed using Microsoft Access and sorted into trap events, which consist of all the photos taken of an animal during its time in front of the cameras (Meek, Ballard, Claridge, Kays, Moseby, O’Brien, O’Connell, …, &amp; Townsend, 2014). The Reconyx cameras captured three pictures for every detection while the Spypoint cameras took one picture for every detection, so the two models’ performances were compared using the number of events instead of the number of detections. Animals were identified by species for each event. Image processing was conducted on a secure computer at the Miistakis Institute office in compliance with the Alberta Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy (FOIP) Act (Province of Alberta, 2019).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cameras in Weaselhead Flats/North Glenmore Park were active from 15 January 2019 to 3 March 2019, and those in Fish Creek Provincial Park were active from 27 January 2019 to 8 March 2019. Due to the cold weather, the NiMH batteries in some Reconyx units repeatedly lost power, reducing the number of trap nights for those cameras (Table 1). Initially, one Spypoint camera was not working and had to be replaced with a different unit (site 64), reducing its number of trap nights (Table 1). To control for these differences in trap nights, the data were standardized to the number of trap events per 100 trap nights (Kelly &amp; Holub, 2008):</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-katex-display-block katex-eq\" data-katex-display=\"true\"><pre>\\textit{RAI}=\\frac{\\textit{no. of events}\\times100}{\\textit{no. of nights}}</pre></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the same standard used by the Miistakis Institute and is referred to in their documents as the relative abundance index, or RAI (Miistakis Institute, 2017). Throughout this paper, the number of trap events per 100 trap nights will be abbreviated to RAI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft Excel was used to calculate RAI values for each species. To increase sample size, all bird species were placed into one category (“bird”). Because the data were not normally distributed, the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for all comparisons. JMP (version 14.1.0) was used for statistical analyses and graphing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Results</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the study, nighttime temperatures often fell below the -18° operating limit specified for the NiMH batteries used in the Reconyx models. Consequently, only four of the ten Reconyx cameras functioned for the entire duration of the study. Furthermore, the camera locks were often frozen, which made changing the Reconyx cameras’ batteries impossible, exacerbating the problem. As a result, a substantial amount of Reconyx data were lost, which may have impacted the study.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Species detected</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nine species were detected during the study (Table 3). White-tailed deer was the most commonly detected species. Bobcat and deer mouse were detected only by the Reconyx cameras. There was no significant difference between the Reconyx and Spypoint cameras with regards to number of coyote detections (W=-7.00, p=0.31; Figure 4A) or deer detections (W=12.50, p=0.44; Figure 4B). Detection of other species did not take place at enough sites to allow for any statistical analysis (Table 3). Taking all species detections into consideration, there was no significant difference between Reconyx and Spypoint models (W=-0.13, p= 0.90; Figure 4C). It should be noted that at every site the camera height of the Spypoint cameras was significantly higher than that of the Reconyx cameras (W=3.44, p=0.0006; Figure 5).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top\" class=\"gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper-constrained wp-image-2905 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" data-reactroot=\"\"><div style=\"max-width:1024px;display:block\"><img alt=\"\" role=\"presentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height=&#x27;247&#x27;

Despite this, the Reconyx cameras still detected more species than did the Spypoint cameras. While the RAI allows for comparison of data from cameras with differing numbers of trap nights, the Spypoint cameras should have a greater probability of detecting wildlife because they were functional for a greater period of time (Rovero et al., 2013). Thus, based on the number of trap nights alone, the Spypoint cameras should detect more species than the Reconyx cameras. The fact that the Reconyx cameras detected more species in fewer trap nights suggests that the model has greater detection ability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two species detected only by Reconyx cameras were bobcat (<em>Lynx rufus</em>) and deer mouse (<em>Peromyscus maniculatus</em>). Although Reconyx cameras have a reputation for being better able to detect smaller mammals (Kelly &amp; Holub, 2008; Wellington et al., 2014) than the game species (e.g., deer) Spypoint cameras were designed to detect, there is little evidence in the literature to suggest that this is actually the case (Driessen et al., 2014). It was suggested that the reason the Spypoint cameras had lower than expected detection rates of bobcat was because bobcats move too quickly to be effectively detected (N. Kahal, pers. comm.). However, the walk-by tests did not find a significant difference in the number of pictures taken between the two camera models. In fact, the only camera that failed to take any photos during a fast walk-by test was a Reconyx camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Camera height has been found to account for variation in detection of species (Meek et al., 2016). To avoid blocking the Spypoint cameras’ solar panels, the Reconyx cameras were placed below the Spypoint cameras at nine sites. Meek et al. (2016) found that cameras placed 300 cm above the ground were less likely to detect species like red foxes and wild dogs (<em>Canis familiaris</em>) than those placed 210 cm lower at 90 cm. The greatest camera height in this study was 118 cm and the greatest difference in height between the two cameras at any site was only 31.25 cm. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the Reconyx and Spypoint cameras in the number of detections of coyote, a species comparable in size to wild dogs. The Spypoint cameras were also able to detect other small mammals such as Eastern grey squirrels and snowshoe hares, which are smaller than bobcats. Therefore, there was little indication that height difference was the reason the Reconyx cameras detected more species than did the Spypoint cameras. Camera placement is affected by many variables such as camera angle, distance from wildlife trails, and slope of the ground between the camera and wildlife trail (Meek et al., 2016). In this study, slope and camera angle may have affected species detections, although data for those variables were not collected so they could not be included in the analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Camera settings such as trigger speed can affect the number of blank (false positive) images taken. If the trigger speed is too slow, it is possible for an animal to move through the field of view before a photo is taken (Wellington et al., 2014). In this study, the Reconyx cameras had a slower trigger speed than the Spypoint cameras, so the Reconyx cameras should have produced more false positives, which was not the case.<br>Only the Spypoint cameras produced malfunctions. This supports Newey et al.’s (2015) results showing that recreational quality cameras have performance limitations. Malfunctions negatively impact the quality of data because researchers often cannot identify the species that triggered the camera detection. Thus, susceptibility to malfunction should be considered when selecting a camera model for a study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was necessary to consider the variation in the number of trap nights in this study to be able to compare the efficacy of the two camera models. There are a variety of methods that have been used in the literature to standardize camera trap data (e.g. Carbone, Christie, Conforti, Franklin, Ginsberg, Griffiths, …, Sharuddin, 2001; O’Brien, Kinnaird, &amp; Wibisono, 2003; O’Brien et al., 2010). This study used the method of Kelly &amp; Holub (2008) to calculate RAIs for consistency with the methodology used by the Miistakis Institute (2017). Sollman, Mohamed, Samejima, &amp; Wilting (2013) criticizes the use of RAIs because factors such as encounter rates, home ranges, trap setup, and repeated surveys all affect data quality, so using RAIs to determine wildlife abundance without considering these factors can return biased results. In this study, the RAI values were not used to extrapolate wildlife abundances, but rather were used to compare data collected by wildlife cameras that operated for different numbers of trap nights. Using the RAI values for this purpose precluded much of the biases described by Sollman et al. (2013).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite operating for fewer trap nights, the Reconyx cameras detected two species that were not detected by the Spypoint cameras. Because the goal of the Calgary Captured project is to document wildlife occupancy in the city, increased species detection is important. Moreover, the Reconyx cameras did not produce malfunctioned images, whereas the Spypoint cameras did. While the Reconyx cameras performed well, the NiMH batteries used did not. Lithium batteries with a specified operating limit of -40° have been used in other winter camera trap studies in Alberta without issue (L. Gould, pers. comm.; K. Anderson, pers. comm.) and may address this problem. Notwithstanding the battery issues in cold weather, Reconyx appears to be the better model in meeting the goals of Calgary Captured because it did not malfunction and was able to detect more species than did the Spypoint cameras despite operating for fewer trap nights</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantages of using wildlife cameras over traditional survey methods include reduced identification errors and false negatives (Vine et al., 2009).

This study compared two wildlife camera models, the Spypoint Solar Trail and the Reconyx Hyperfire 2, on behalf of Calgary Captured, a collaborative project between the Miistakis Institute and the City of Calgary to determine wildlife occupancy in Calgary’s Natural Area Parks. The camera models were set up in pairs at 10 sites. There was no significant difference in detections of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) or coyotes (Canis latrans) by either model, but the Reconyx cameras successfully captured two species that the Spypoint model failed to detect: bobcat (Lynx rufus) and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). The Reconyx cameras had fewer trap days because the Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries supplied by Calgary Captured consistently failed in cold weather, whereas the Spypoint cameras’ solar panels continued to function through the duration of the study. Despite having had fewer trap days, the Reconyx cameras captured more species than did the Spypoint cameras. There was no significant difference in the number of false positives and false negatives produced by the two models, but only the Spypoint cameras produced malfunctioned images. For projects like Calgary Captured, the Reconyx Hyperfire 2 is a more effective camera model than the Spypoint Solar Trail because it captures more species and is less prone to malfunction. The results of this study also highlight the importance of choosing appropriate batteries and settings for the camera model in question to ensure successful use.","pdfLink":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/2190d663cec600da27c774f4ecfe4895/51-Pizante.pdf"}},"citation":"Pizante, R.

Obtaining iron, however, presents a challenge particularly for microorganisms living in iron-limited environments (Butler &amp; Sandy, 2009). While iron is the 4th most abundant transition metal on the planet, the insolubility of Fe(III) (ferric iron – Ksp of Fe(OH)3 = 6.0 x 10-38) and Fe(II) (ferrous iron – Ksp of Fe(OH)2 = 2.0 x 10−15) at physiological pH in aerobic environments severely limits the biological availability of this essential nutrient (Sillén et al., 1964). Marine organisms face a greater challenge than terrestrial organisms, as seawater contains 0.001-0.003 ppm of available iron in comparison to 0.5-1 ppm in river water and 100 ppm in groundwater (Lenntech, n.d.). Despite low oceanic iron concentrations, phytoplankton are the world’s most influential primary photosynthetic producers, producing an estimated 50-85% of the planet’s oxygen (Lin et al., 2003). It follows that phytoplankton are capable of intaking large volumes (30-50%) of the world’s carbon dioxide (CO2) to carry out photosynthetic processes, thereby transforming the ocean into the largest carbon sink on the planet (Block, 2018; The Earth Institute, 2009).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It had been determined by 1980 that phytoplankton photosynthesis is limited by iron bio-availability, as opposed to other essential nutrients. Iron is a natural fertilizer and an essential nutrient for the synthesis of chlorophyll and electron transport proteins in plants, including phytoplankton. Without it, they are unable to reduce carbon dioxide and create the organic compounds needed for their survival (Paytan &amp; Street, 2005). John Martin of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories hypothesized that by increasing the amount of bio-available iron in oceans, overall photosynthetic processes would increase, and the ability for the ocean to sequester carbon from the atmosphere would increase accordingly; this was coined the Iron Hypothesis (Weier, 2001). This hypothesis has been tested on more than 10 different occasions and in all cases, massive phytoplankton blooms have resulted. However, the results are not consistent. Blooms persisted for variable periods of time under various, uncontrolled, open ocean conditions, and the effectiveness of phytoplankton blooms in sequestering carbon has yet to be confirmed (Paytan &amp; Street, 2005). This minireview will explore the question pervading the minds of oceanographers, marine biologists/chemists, environmental scientists and geoengineers alike: can iron fertilization in the Southern Ocean, through increasing the primary productivity of phytoplankton, accelerate carbon sequestration in the deep ocean, therefore decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations? This review will examine papers on three iron fertilization experiments in the Southern Ocean and their findings. Themes between papers on each experiment will be examined, focusing first on the contributions of each paper to the progression of the field and then on weaknesses that could be addressed through further experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the original guiding principles upon which understanding of marine biogeochemistry was based was the correlation between macronutrient availability and phytoplankton production. Yet, observations and experiments conducted in the 1920s suggested high marine nutrient levels but low phytoplankton biomass (High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll or HNLC) occurring uniquely in the Southern Ocean. This dilemma came to be known as the Antarctic paradox (Broecker &amp; Peng, 1991). It was the attempt to reconcile the Antarctic paradox that spurred research on nutrient levels in the Southern Ocean. It was not until the late 1980s that improvements in analytical techniques confirmed low dissolved iron levels and thus the potential to accelerate phytoplankton processes in the open Southern Ocean via iron fertilization (Ducklow, Hanson, Field, 2000). With the emergence of the Iron Hypothesis came the increased importance of iron’s role in the Southern Ocean, as the threat of dangerous atmospheric carbon levels loomed with no solution in sight. The study of the response of biogeochemical cycling in the surface mixed layer to iron enrichment was unfortunately limited at the time. Modelling simulations of the influence of iron enrichment in the Southern Ocean on atmospheric CO2 levels had yet to be verified and validated (Broecker &amp; Peng, 1991). In the absence of data, such models assumed that iron enrichment resulted in complete utilization of upper ocean macronutrients. Yet these predictions did not align with results from lab experiments (Boyd et al., 2007) nor observations on natural blooms in the open Southern Ocean (Keith &amp; Moore, 1999). These issues could only be addressed by conducting an in-situ iron fertilization experiment in open Southern Ocean waters to assess what controls the magnitude of phytoplankton stocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two steps to sequestering atmospheric carbon. First, removal from the atmosphere; second, conversion to a form that is unable to re-enter the atmosphere. Currently, the most effective carbon removal on the planet is performed by photosynthesizers, a role filled in ocean ecosystems by phytoplankton. Phytoplankton in the upper ocean fix carbon dioxide using solar energy. This fixation results in particulate organic carbon (POC), which is grazed upon by herbivorous zooplankton or consumed directly or indirectly by heterotrophic microbes feeding on solubilized remains of phytoplankton. Between 1 and 40% of the primary production is exported out of the upper ocean, and it exponentially attenuates towards the base of the mesopelagic zone at around 1,000m deep (Broecker &amp; Peng, 1991). Remineralization of organic matter in the oceanic water column converts the organic carbon back to carbon dioxide. Hence, only about 1% of the surface production reaches the sea floor (Fig. 1). Carbon that reaches the sea floor to enter the lithosphere exits as inorganic calcium carbonate, which reacts with the low-pH ocean to produce CO2 to be released into the atmosphere, however, the majority remains sequestered. This cycle is called the biological pump, and it is one of several ways carbon can be sequestered in the ocean. Other oceanic carbon inputs include particle deposition, biotic debris, and atmospheric CO2 diffusion, and are sequestered by processes not specified in this paper (Fig. 2).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top\" class=\"gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper-constrained wp-image-2919 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" data-reactroot=\"\"><div style=\"max-width:840px;display:block\"><img alt=\"\" role=\"presentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height=&#x27;442&#x27; width=&#x27;840&#x27; xmlns=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#x27; version=&#x27;1.1&#x27;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" style=\"max-width:100%;display:block;position:static\"/></div><div aria-hidden=\"true\" data-placeholder-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%\"></div><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" data-srcset=\"/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/deed1/FowlesF1.webp 210w,/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/00b4f/FowlesF1.webp 420w,/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/40ce0/FowlesF1.webp 840w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 840px) 840px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"1\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 840px) 840px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/7b141/FowlesF1.png\" data-srcset=\"/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/732d1/FowlesF1.png 210w,/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/ea0a7/FowlesF1.png 420w,/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/7b141/FowlesF1.png 840w\" alt=\"\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcSet=\"/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/deed1/FowlesF1.webp 210w,/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/00b4f/FowlesF1.webp 420w,/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/40ce0/FowlesF1.webp 840w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 840px) 840px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"1\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 840px) 840px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/7b141/FowlesF1.png\" srcSet=\"/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/732d1/FowlesF1.png 210w,/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/ea0a7/FowlesF1.png 420w,/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/7b141/FowlesF1.png 840w\" alt=\"\"/></picture></noscript><script type=\"module\">const t=\"undefined\"!=typeof HTMLImageElement&&\"loading\"in HTMLImageElement.prototype;if(t){const t=document.querySelectorAll(\"img[data-main-image]\");for(let e of t){e.dataset.src&&(e.setAttribute(\"src\",e.dataset.src),e.removeAttribute(\"data-src\")),e.dataset.srcset&&(e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\"));const t=e.parentNode.querySelectorAll(\"source[data-srcset]\");for(let e of t)e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\");e.complete&&(e.style.opacity=1)}}</script></div><script type=\"application/json\" data-wp-inline-image-hydration=\"1\">{\"image\":{\"layout\":\"constrained\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#38c8d8\",\"images\":{\"fallback\":{\"src\":\"/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/7b141/FowlesF1.png\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/732d1/FowlesF1.png 210w,\\n/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/ea0a7/FowlesF1.png 420w,\\n/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/7b141/FowlesF1.png 840w\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 840px) 840px, 100vw\"},\"sources\":[{\"srcSet\":\"/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/deed1/FowlesF1.webp 210w,\\n/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/00b4f/FowlesF1.webp 420w,\\n/static/2a32a0344c2d252c5fa83030ea4ab112/40ce0/FowlesF1.webp 840w\",\"type\":\"image/webp\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 840px) 840px, 100vw\"}]},\"width\":840,\"height\":442},\"alt\":\"\",\"className\":\"wp-image-2919 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\",\"data-wp-inline-image\":\"1\"}</script><figcaption><strong>Fig 1 </strong>Simplified diagram depicting the movement of carbon throughout the lithosphere (rock), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air) as understood during SOIREE.

Approximately 165 mol/km2 of FeSO4 · 7H2O was added to a 65-m deep surface mixed layer over an area of 50 km2. Croot et al. (2001) sought to distinguish SOIREE as an experiment that pointed to the previously unheralded importance of Fe(II) and organic complexation in the Southern Ocean. This mindset was shared amongst many of the marine biogeochemists studying SOIREE. Boyd et al. (2000) were convinced the findings of SOIREE not only provided context and significance for iron’s role in surface phytoplankton ecosystems, but allegedly confirmed the Iron Hypothesis in its findings on “the relative roles of iron supply, uptake, algal growth and community structure, and grazing” (p. 699). From further study on iron fertilization it is evident the researchers had not confirmed the Iron Hypothesis in its entirety, as both the mechanisms and rate or length of enhanced photosynthesis had yet to be determined. Additionally, the mechanism by which carbon dioxide was sequestered remained a mystery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage of in-situ experiments is the incorporation of natural large-scale ocean phenomena that potentially affect the rate, length, and efficiency of photosynthetic carbon sequestration absent from underdeveloped simulations or lab experiments. These phenomena could provide insight on the length of time carbon is sequestered away in the ocean before returning to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (Fig. 2). Law &amp; Boyd (2001) recognized this gap in the research in their conclusions, stating that the fate of accumulated carbon, once used in photosynthesis, could only be speculated. Whether it was remineralized into inorganic CO2 and returned to the atmosphere or subducted along with the carbon-rich remains of phytoplankton – or both – was undetermined. Thus, the longer-term sequestration of carbon in the Southern Ocean could not be extrapolated and the magnitude of the iron enrichment effect on marine production and atmospheric CO2 remained uncertain (Buesseler, 2004).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SOFeX (Southern Ocean Iron Experiment): 2002</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Between SOIREE and SOFeX the German EisenEx (2000) iron fertilization experiment took place in the Southern Ocean but will not be discussed in this review due to its proximity to SOIREE (occurring less than a year after the first experiment). Consequently, the advancement in the field of marine biogeochemistry and insight on the Iron Hypothesis were minimal. One notable finding is the influence of mechanical stirring of the ocean surface on phytoplankton bloom success. EisenEx saw a bloom four times more efficient in drawing CO2 from the atmosphere than the SOIREE bloom due to stormier oceans in the northern section of the Southern Ocean, north of the Antarctic Polar Front (Bakker et al., 2005). Despite this finding, the researchers of EisenEx had made no progress on examining the biological or carbon systems that drive phytoplankton carbon sequestration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SOFeX was the first iron fertilization experiment designed to examine the biological and carbon system response to the effects of purposeful addition of iron to high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) waters in the Southern Ocean, specifically the polar front zone (PFZ). Multiple enrichments were performed on areas of 225 km2 to total approximately 88 mol/km2 of FeSO4 north and south of the PFZ (Bishop, 2004). In previous iron fertilization experiments in the Southern Ocean, the demonstration of an obvious carbon flux response in the atmosphere or the phytoplankton ecosystem was absent, although in every case enhanced primary production and a biomass increase was reported (Buesseler, 2004). SOFeX sought to eliminate the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of iron fertilization in sequestering CO2 by taking a multifaceted approach to measuring carbon flux in the ocean and atmosphere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In marine environments, sequestration often proceeds via the biological pump, which incorporates phytoplankton photosynthesis, bioaccumulation, and particulate organic carbon (POC) sedimentation (Fig. 1) (Herndl &amp; Reinthaler, 2013). This process is more specific than the cycling SOIREE researchers explored (Fig. 2) and directly addresses the mechanisms that constitute the relationship between phytoplankton and carbon sequestration. Researchers of the SOFeX experiment measured the extent of the biological pump in iron fertilized areas. Their approach would account for the gap Law &amp; Boyd recognized in their research in 2001: the unknown fate of accumulated carbon once utilized in phytoplankton photosynthesis. The amount of carbon that sank to the ocean floor because of fertilization could finally be determined by updated technology not available during SOIREE. Bishop et al. (2004) deployed autonomous submarine sensors to investigate the systematics of POC export with an optically derived carbon flux index at depths of up to 1000 m. Buesseler et al. (2004) engaged an autonomous float to measure carbon flux at the ocean’s surface. By interpreting the data obtained from these instruments, SOFeX researchers concluded that iron addition indeed had a measurable impact on carbon sequestration rates. Carbon flux increases were not limited to the top, iron-fertilized layer of the ocean, but also below in the “shadow” of the SOFeX patch (Buesseler, 2004).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers, however, admitted to difficulties in predicting the impact of iron fertilization on atmospheric carbon composition because the timespan of carbon remineralization and the large-scale impacts of iron enrichment on processes below the surface layer had yet to be understood. In other words, SOFeX demonstrated technological progress in terms of carbon inputs to a biological system but lacked the acknowledgement of carbon outputs. Despite prolonged observation of the bloom, the absence of data on the magnitude of remineralization left the potential for gaps when considering net sequestration over a long period of time. They “[did] not know whether the bloom eventually led to substantially higher C export after [they] left, or whether organic matter was remineralized within the surface ocean, resulting in no additional impact on C sequestration.” (Buesseler, 2004, p. 417). This had the potential to pose an issue for geoengineers exploring iron fertilization as an option for carbon capture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even excluding remineralization, many researchers who studied SOFeX are worried that the amount of carbon dioxide sequestered in experiments is not nearly enough to address rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Carbon flux measurements were taken for the first time during SOFeX, and their results were not promising. Coale et al. (2004) found the flux of carbon, although significant, was similar in magnitude to that of natural blooms in the Southern Ocean and thus small relative to global carbon budgets and proposed geoengineering plans to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide in the deep sea. Buesseler et al. (2004) failed to see how iron fertilization with such a low C(sequestered): Fe(added) export efficiency could scale up to solve larger global C imbalance problems without consuming tons of iron salts. Only further exploration of carbon transport within and below phytoplankton blooms as well as further insight on the mechanisms of carbon uptake would provide geoengineers with the information needed to continue or abandon iron fertilization as an option for lowering atmospheric CO2 levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>LOHAFEX (Iron Fertilization Experiment): 2007</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>LOHAFEX is the most recent iron fertilization performed in the Southern Ocean. ~101 mol/km2 of FeSO4 · 7H2O was added to an area of 150 km2. While all previous experiments showed an enhancement of primary production and biomass in response to iron increases in phytoplankton blooms, the relatively short duration of these studies did not allow researchers to determine the fate of exported POC from said blooms. Many studies on LOHAFEX aimed to understand the impact of an artificial iron-induced bloom in terms of mesopelagic remineralization processes (Martin et al., 2013). It is important to note that the shallow export flux of POC, often measured at 100 m, generally does not sequester carbon from the atmosphere for climatically relevant time scales. Long-term sequestration requires POC to sink below the permanent thermocline, and it is this deeper flux that would need enhancing for geoengineering to work (Buesseler, 2008). POC flux can decrease sharply between these two depths, and the magnitude of this decrease depends on the biological make-up in the surface and mesopelagic (Boyd &amp; Buessler, 2009; Jacquet et al., 2008; Buesseler, 2007; Bishop &amp; Lam, 2007). Thus, enhancing POC export does not necessarily enhance carbon sequestration. Therefore, examining both the remineralization processes and the depth to which particles sink, as demonstrated by LOHAFEX, is of the utmost importance when determining the sequestration potential of iron fertilization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advances in sediment collection and analysis allowed researchers to differentiate between types of POC export, revealing the majority of POC undergoing downward flux is faecal matter from zooplankton feeding on phytoplankton in excess. The decrease of faecal pellets with depth, and the increase in unrecognisable detritus particles observed points to intense reprocessing (consumption &amp; excretion) of faecal pellets by heterotrophic bacteria and plankton at greater depths (Ebersbach et al., 2014). Ebersbach et al. believe this means two things, both of which result in an increase of carbon output from the system: <i>i</i>) the smaller, reprocessed faecal pellets sink more slowly, providing a greater chance for remineralization before descending past the thermocline, ii) heterotrophic bacteria in the process of consuming faecal pellets release CO2 as they respire and defecate. Despite this, mesopelagic remineralization levels during iron fertilization remain far below natural mesopelagic remineralization levels (Ebersbach et al., 2014). Jacquet et al. (2008) found that export from large, artificial phytoplankton blooms is less prone to remineralization than natural blooms. Their explanation for their observations is incompatible with Ebersbach’s analysis, for Jacquet assumes a faster transfer of matter through the water column leaving less time for mesopelagic remineralization to occur, even including heterotrophic reprocessing. Jacquet claims heterotrophic reprocessing is slowed because of low water temperatures. This conflict around the speed of POC sinking has yet to be resolved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to remineralization research, many studies on particle flux characterisation and sedimentation patterns within and below the phytoplankton bloom reveal particle flux decreases strongly between 100 and 200–450m (Martin et al., 2013). This indicates that little POC is attaining depths below the thermocline, indicating that long-term sequestration is unlikely to be enhanced. On top of this, Martin et al. (2013) claim iron fertilization enhances neither shallow export nor deep POC flux based on their observations, supporting Ebersbach’s analysis. These findings contradict the idea that iron fertilization stimulates POC export and sequestration in Southern Ocean HNLC conditions. However, such conclusions ignore the higher transfer efficiencies of flux to depths that have been reported upon collapse of these artificial blooms. With the deaths of so many organisms and their carbon carcasses falling to the ocean floor, large quantities of carbon sink past the thermocline due to sheer numbers. LOHAFEX was designed to be a long-term experiment for this very reason, allowing the iron-fertilized phytoplankton bloom to be monitored “until its senescence and decay, thereby closing a gap in our understanding of carbon transport” (Thiele et al., 2012). Unfortunately, the long-term monitoring of the LOHAFEX bloom never came to fruition due to its early conclusion in response to protests from environmental campaigns about the potentially harmful effects of iron fertilization.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The probability that iron fertilization will be implemented on a large scale to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide is slim. The optimism arising from the initial conception of the Iron Hypothesis has faded, and which is supported by scientific evidence. As technology improves and datasets grow, our understanding of oceanic carbon sequestration has increased greatly, alongside the realization that oceanic carbon fixation processes are much more complicated than originally believed. These experiments are costly and difficult to run, and the environmental side effects of interfering with an ecosystem to such a great extent are unknown. It is for this reason that iron fertilization experiments in the Southern Ocean have not taken place in over a decade, and computers are taking over in the hopes that climate models will provide the solution to excessive atmospheric CO2 levels that the world is waiting for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real barrier to answering the outlined research question stems not from large gaps in knowledge or unclear results from research. It comes from the distrust of geoengineering. Scientists and the public alike fear repercussions from the deliberate imbalance of biological systems and nutrient cycles. This is not an unjustified fear, for it is the anthropogenic imbalance of global systems which generated dangerous climate change in the first place. Luckily, in-situ experiments are no longer the only method of accumulating accurate data, for models have improved drastically since 1999. Key findings from iron fertilization experiments offer new insights for modellers, although a limited number of these findings can be extrapolated directly to regional and seasonal scales for iron enrichment (Table 1). Such limited extrapolation speaks to limitations in experimental design and to uncertainties in the understanding of iron biogeochemistry (Boyd et al., 2007).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modelling studies can improve our understanding of iron biogeochemistry by allowing for different conditions to be altered in a short time span and without risk of environmental repercussions. For example, as opposed to adding iron in one large dose, breaking the addition up into smaller, more frequent doses could result in more sustained blooms. Altering other nutrient concentrations such as silicon, barium, or nitrogen may be effective (Boyd et al., 2007). The technologies available today (and the countless more that will be available in the future) will allow research into iron fertilization as a method of accelerated carbon sequestration to be explored deeper than ever before. Perhaps one day iron will be more than an essential nutrient &#8211; it will be the key to maintaining life on Earth.</p>\n","uri":"/marine-iron-fertilization-effects-on-on-phytoplankton-carbon-uptake-in-the-southern-ocean/","articleMetadata":{"articleData":{"abstract":"The scarcity of iron in marine environments, particularly in the Southern Ocean, provides ideal experimental grounds for large-scale iron fertilization.

Past the boiling point of a compound, an interesting phenomenon can be observed which allows the compound to maintain liquid or even solid form while in contact with a superheated surface (Bernardin et al., 1999; Biance et al., 2003; Cole et al., 2015; Hashmi et al., 2012; Lagubeau et al., 2011; Linke et al., 2006; Ok et al., 2011; Quéré, 2013; Walker, 1994; Wells et al., 2015). Most famously, when a liquid water droplet is placed onto a superheated aluminium surface (hotter than its boiling temperature) a vapour layer instantaneously forms underneath the droplet, insulating the liquid water and thereby preventing its rapid evaporation. Water vapour conducts thermal energy approximately one order of magnitude lower than liquid water (Walker, 1994). The temperature at which the droplet exists for the longest time is called the Leidenfrost temperature. Near the Leidenfrost temperature, liquid water droplets can be maintained for several minutes (Biance et al., 2003; Lagubeau, et al., 2011; for review see Quéré, 2013).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As first demonstrated by Linke et al. (2006), liquid water droplets on a superheated metal slab with ratchet-like topography travel in a well-defined direction with a well-defined velocity. This locomotive force is thought to be caused by the exiting of vapour under the droplet directed by the asymmetric topography of the metal surface (Lagubeau et al., 2011, Linke et al., 2006). Following the successful proof-of-concept study (Linke et al., 2006), many practical applications have been envisioned for the Leidenfrost system. The low friction environment and lack of moving parts alludes to an efficient and potentially advantageous mechanism for transporting liquid, dissolved solutes, or supported objects. Hashmi et al. (2012) showed that multiple Leidenfrost drops traveling together could be harnessed to transport ‘carts’ weighing up to 50 g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cole et al. (2015) showed that it is possible to engineer the trajectory of a Leidenfrost droplet to be sensitive to surface temperature. This discovery opened up a wide possibility for feedback cooling mechanisms that do not rely on electrical or moving components. Ok et al. (2011) observed that ratchet-like structures can help injected droplets adhere to the hot metal surface. This allows for a controlled and continuous transfer of heat, a necessary requirement for fuel-injection and combustion systems, steam generators, cooling systems for nuclear reactors, and spray quenching systems (Ok et al., 2011).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The incentive to develop technologies that exploit the Leidenfrost effect motivates our present work. The engine efficiency of a system that relies on the Leidenfrost effect to produce mechanical work in a straight line has not been previously calculated in the literature. However, Wells et al. (2015) constructed a Leidenfrost turbine which applies a torque to a solid carbon-dioxide disk, producing rotational motion. Their system relied on a similar ratchet like-topography to turn a dry-ice disk which sublimated on contact with a superheated aluminium surface (Wells et al., 2015). The engine efficiency of the turbine system was reported to be on the order of 1E-06%. In our experiment, two parameters thought to affect the dynamics of the water droplet were examined: ratchet angle and droplet volume. These parameters were varied within reasonable values based on the available literature.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aluminium slabs were machined to have an asymmetric ratchet-like surface topography (Fig. 1). Table 1 provides the dimensions of the machined aluminium slabs with 15° and 30° ratchet angles. These dimensions closely resemble those studied by Linke et al (2006). The slabs were positioned on a hot-plate perpendicular to a Canon T3i® DSLR camera and a thermocouple was used to monitor the surface temperature of the slabs. One end of the thermocouple was placed in a beaker of ice-water (0° Celsius) and the other was coiled tightly around an accessory aluminium slab, used as a weight, to measure hotplate surface temperature. The camera was mounted level to the experimental setup to record position-time data. A magnetic-assist pipette was used to control the droplet volume which was varied between 15-35 µL in 5 µL increments. Droplets of this size reliably accelerated in the expected direction, did not spontaneously divide, and could be manually deposited onto the superheated surface with relative ease. A water droplet accelerating due to the Leidenfrost effect after pipetting is shown in Fig. 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top\" class=\"gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper-constrained wp-image-2925 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" data-reactroot=\"\"><div style=\"max-width:844px;display:block\"><img alt=\"\" role=\"presentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg height=&#x27;145&#x27; width=&#x27;844&#x27; xmlns=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#x27; version=&#x27;1.1&#x27;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" style=\"max-width:100%;display:block;position:static\"/></div><div aria-hidden=\"true\" data-placeholder-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%\"></div><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" data-srcset=\"/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/166bc/ArsenauPhilippF1.webp 211w,/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/d60aa/ArsenauPhilippF1.webp 422w,/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/be6dd/ArsenauPhilippF1.webp 844w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 844px) 844px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"1\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 844px) 844px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/cc0f4/ArsenauPhilippF1.png\" data-srcset=\"/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/32efe/ArsenauPhilippF1.png 211w,/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/7941a/ArsenauPhilippF1.png 422w,/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/cc0f4/ArsenauPhilippF1.png 844w\" alt=\"\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcSet=\"/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/166bc/ArsenauPhilippF1.webp 211w,/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/d60aa/ArsenauPhilippF1.webp 422w,/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/be6dd/ArsenauPhilippF1.webp 844w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 844px) 844px, 100vw\"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr=\"\" data-wp-inline-image=\"1\" data-main-image=\"\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;transform:translateZ(0);transition:opacity 250ms linear;width:100%;will-change:opacity;opacity:0\" sizes=\"(min-width: 844px) 844px, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/cc0f4/ArsenauPhilippF1.png\" srcSet=\"/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/32efe/ArsenauPhilippF1.png 211w,/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/7941a/ArsenauPhilippF1.png 422w,/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/cc0f4/ArsenauPhilippF1.png 844w\" alt=\"\"/></picture></noscript><script type=\"module\">const t=\"undefined\"!=typeof HTMLImageElement&&\"loading\"in HTMLImageElement.prototype;if(t){const t=document.querySelectorAll(\"img[data-main-image]\");for(let e of t){e.dataset.src&&(e.setAttribute(\"src\",e.dataset.src),e.removeAttribute(\"data-src\")),e.dataset.srcset&&(e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\"));const t=e.parentNode.querySelectorAll(\"source[data-srcset]\");for(let e of t)e.setAttribute(\"srcset\",e.dataset.srcset),e.removeAttribute(\"data-srcset\");e.complete&&(e.style.opacity=1)}}</script></div><script type=\"application/json\" data-wp-inline-image-hydration=\"1\">{\"image\":{\"layout\":\"constrained\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#f8f8f8\",\"images\":{\"fallback\":{\"src\":\"/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/cc0f4/ArsenauPhilippF1.png\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/32efe/ArsenauPhilippF1.png 211w,\\n/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/7941a/ArsenauPhilippF1.png 422w,\\n/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/cc0f4/ArsenauPhilippF1.png 844w\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 844px) 844px, 100vw\"},\"sources\":[{\"srcSet\":\"/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/166bc/ArsenauPhilippF1.webp 211w,\\n/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/d60aa/ArsenauPhilippF1.webp 422w,\\n/static/0ccd86b65ebc94d2016357baf1e402fa/be6dd/ArsenauPhilippF1.webp 844w\",\"type\":\"image/webp\",\"sizes\":\"(min-width: 844px) 844px, 100vw\"}]},\"width\":844,\"height\":145},\"alt\":\"\",\"className\":\"wp-image-2925 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\",\"data-wp-inline-image\":\"1\"}</script><figcaption><strong>Fig 1 </strong>Close-up of aluminum slab with ratchet-like topography.

An established protocol (Table 2) was implemented and determined which replicates would contribute to the average engine efficiency. The protocol ensured the water droplets were initially stationary and were only accelerating due to the Leidenfrost effect. Recorded videos of the accepted replicates were analysed using Logger Pro 3® motion-tracking software. The known length of the ramp was used as a calibration scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Efficiency calculation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Energy efficiency was calculated by measuring the mechanical work done on the Leidenfrost droplet and the energy input from the hotplate, as summarized by the following equation:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-katex-display-block katex-eq\" data-katex-display=\"true\"><pre>\\textit{Efficiency}=\\left(\\frac{\\textit{Work}}{\\textit{Energy input}}\\right)\\times100</pre></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Work refers to mechanical work done in the direction perpendicular to the aluminium ratchets, across the full length of the slab. The work for a given replicate was calculated by numerically integrating the force function with respect to position, similar to the method used by Linke et al. (2006):</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-katex-display-block katex-eq\" data-katex-display=\"true\"><pre>\\textit{Work}=\\int^{x}\\vec{F}\\left(x'\\right)\\cdot dx'</pre></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Position, velocity, and acceleration was determined using Logger Pro 3® software and a Canon T3i shooting at 60fps. Acceleration in the direction across the full length of the aluminium slab was considered work; all other acceleration was considered a system inefficiency. Using Newton’s second law and the known mass of the water droplet, force was calculated as a function of position. The mass for each water droplet was calculated using the known droplet volume and the density of water at room temperature (1g/mL). The droplet density was assumed to be that at room temperature as the droplet was well-insulated by the vapour layer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instantaneous acceleration was calculated by taking the second-order time derivative of the position-time data using finite difference in Logger Pro 3®. The change in position between each time step was calculated using position-time data, converting acceleration as a function of time to acceleration as a function of position (relative to the initial starting position of the droplet). After obtaining force as a function of position, a midpoint rule Riemann sum with a 16.683 ms time-step was used to numerically approximate Eq. (2). The standard deviation for work was calculated between replicates of the same trial (same droplet volume and ratchet angle).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Energy input was measured using a power meter. The power input was monitored over a three-hour period and a constant power input of 266.67 J/s was observed. The energy input for a given replicate was calculated by multiplying the total time the water droplet spent in contact with the aluminium slab, by the constant power input. Uncertainty in the power measurement was defined as the digital uncertainty in the power meter:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-katex-display-block katex-eq\" data-katex-display=\"true\"><pre>\\textit{Energy input}=\\textit{Replicate time}\\times266.67\\textup{J/s}</pre></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Results</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To determine if we had reproduced the experimental conditions of Linke et al. (2006), we measured the average acceleration as a function of droplet volume. Comparing with their Fig. 5, our average droplet acceleration for 15° ratchet angle and 30 µL droplet volume, was 0.245 m/s2, which agrees with the value obtained by Linke et al. for 30 µL to one significant figure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Figures 4 &amp; 5 show the engine efficiency versus droplet volume for Slabs 1 &amp; 2 respectively (see Table 1). Fig. 4 shows a relatively large standard deviation for the 30 µL trial which motivated us to double the sample size. After taking more measurements, the relatively large standard deviation persisted. The sample size was similarly doubled for 30 µL in Fig. 5 to allow for a comparison between ratchet angles. A least-squares fit was performed to determine the linearity of the relationship. For the steeper 30° ratchet angle, increasing droplet volume in the 15-35 µL range tends to marginally improve engine efficiency. The low R2 value in Fig. 5 does not support a similar trend for the shallower 15° ratchet angle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"693\" height=\"388\" src=\"/static/3c99704ed6aeaa2ed0892a012b29e3d1/ArsenauPhilippF4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2931\" srcset=\"/static/3c99704ed6aeaa2ed0892a012b29e3d1/ArsenauPhilippF4.png 693w, http://canadian-journal-of-undergraduate-research.local/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ArsenauPhilippF4-300x168.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px\" /><figcaption><strong>Fig 4 </strong>Engine efficiency versus droplet volume for Slab 1 (see Table 1).

This is because the average work done on a Leidenfrost droplet was extremely low relative to the energy input. The extremely low engine efficiency is not dissimilar to that obtained by Wells et al. (2015) which was reported to be on the order of 1E-06%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Table 3 compares the mean engine efficiencies between the aluminium slabs with 30° and 15° ratchet angles. A two-sample t-Test for equal means was used to infer a change in mean efficiency between slabs:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-katex-display-block katex-eq\" data-katex-display=\"true\"><pre>T=\\frac{\\mu_1-\\mu_2 }{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(\\sigma_1\\right )^2}{N_1}+\\frac{\\left(\\sigma_2\\right )^2}{N_2}}}</pre></div>\n\n\n\n<p>μ1 and μ2 are the sample means for Slab 1 and Slab 2 respectively, σ1 and σ2 are the sample standard deviations, and N1 and N2 are the sample sizes. A p-value (two-tailed), was generated from the two sample T-test. A p-value greater than 0.05 does not allow one to conclude that varying ratchet angle from 30° to 15° has a statistically meaningful effect on engine efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The discrepancy between our calculated engine efficiency and the engine efficiency calculated by Wells et al. (2015) may be explained by the difference in exposed hotplate area. Hotplate area that is not in direct contact with the aluminium slab heats the surrounding air which does not contribute to the total work. The exposed hotplate area in our experimental setup seems to be larger than the exposed hotplate area in Wells et al.’s (2015) experiment. The discrepancy may also be explained by the difference in transport load. The maximum load for an insulated carbon-dioxide disk is much larger than the maximum load for a stable water droplet. A larger load would increase the work done and therefore increase engine efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to reach the Leidenfrost temperature of water, a large amount of input energy was required. Liquids with lower Leidenfrost temperatures would decrease the required energy input and therefore increase engine efficiency. Moreover, Leidenfrost ‘carts’ could increase engine efficiency. In a recent development by Hashmi et al., loads as massive as 50 g were supported by multiple Leidenfrost droplets travelling together. A higher load capacity could dramatically increase the engine efficiency of a Leidenfrost droplet transport system and a similar calculation to our present work should be performed for the ‘cart’ system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Varying the droplet volume and ratchet angle within the experimental values did not have a major effect on engine efficiency. Efficiency optimization must be achieved by varying other parameters such as ratchet size (Ok et al., 2011), or by making significant design changes to the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The engine efficiency of a Leidenfrost droplet transport system, which transports droplets in a straight line, was calculated. Our results give an extremely low average percent efficiency (2.86E-07%), which agrees with the result from Wells et al. (2015) for an analogous turbine system, to an order of magnitude. Differences in exposed hotplate area and maximum load between the two experiments may explain the difference in calculated engine efficiency. Droplet volume and ratchet angle were varied in an attempt to optimize engine efficiency. Varying the ratchet angle does not affect efficiency to any statistically meaningful extent. Increasing droplet volume in the 15-35 µL range tends to marginally improve engine efficiency for steep ratchet angles. Further optimization must therefore be achieved by varying other parameters such at ratchet size or by making significant design changes to the system. Leidenfrost ‘carts’, which rely on multiple Leidenfrost droplets travelling together to support more massive loads, may provide a mechanism to dramatically increase the engine efficiency of a Leidenfrost droplet transport system.</p>\n","uri":"/engine-efficiency-of-a-leidenfrost-droplet-transport-system/","articleMetadata":{"articleData":{"abstract":"We calculate the engine efficiency of a Leidenfrost droplet transport system to assess application for various industrial processes.
